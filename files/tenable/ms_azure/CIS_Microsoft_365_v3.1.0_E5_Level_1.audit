Set up anti-phishing polices to increase this protection, for example by refining settings to better detect and prevent impersonation and spoofing attacks. The default policy applies to all users within the organization and is a single view to fine-tune anti-phishing protection. Custom policies can be created and configured for specific users, groups or domains within the organization and will take precedence over the default policy for the scoped users.

Rationale:

Protects users from phishing attacks (like impersonation and spoofing), and uses safety tips to warn users about potentially harmful messages.

Impact:

Turning on Anti-Phishing should not cause an impact; messages will be displayed when applicable.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

This is an essential tool to bolster protection for users who are frequently targeted due to their critical positions, such as executives, leaders, managers, or others who have access to sensitive, confidential, financial, or high-priority information.

Once these accounts are identified, several services and features can be enabled, including threat policies, enhanced sign-in protection through conditional access policies, and alert policies, enabling faster response times for incident response teams.

Rationale:

Enabling priority account protection for users in Microsoft 365 is necessary to enhance security for accounts with access to sensitive data and high privileges, such as CEOs, CISOs, CFOs, and IT admins. These priority accounts are often targeted by spear phishing or whaling attacks and require stronger protection to prevent account compromise.

To address this, Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 offer several key features that provide extra security, including the identification of incidents and alerts involving priority accounts and the use of built-in custom protections designed specifically for them.

These priority accounts are often targeted by spear phishing or whaling attacks and require stronger protection to prevent account compromise.

The implementation of stringent, pre-defined policies may result in instances of false positive, however, the benefit of requiring the end-user to preview junk email before accessing their inbox outweighs the potential risk of mistakenly perceiving a malicious email as safe due to its placement in the inbox.

These reviews can be scheduled to recur regularly, with flexible options for delegating the task of reviewing membership to different members of the organization.

Ensure Access reviews for Guest Users are configured to be performed no less frequently than monthly.

Rationale:

Access to groups and applications for guests can change over time. If a guest user's access to a particular folder goes unnoticed, they may unintentionally gain access to sensitive data if a member adds new files or data to the folder or application. Access reviews can help reduce the risks associated with outdated assignments by requiring a member of the organization to conduct the reviews. Furthermore, these reviews can enable a fail-closed mechanism to remove access to the subject if the reviewer does not respond to the review.

Impact:

Access reviews that are ignored may cause guest users to lose access to resources temporarily.

  description : "6.1.3 Ensure mailbox auditing for E5 users is Enabled"
  info        : "Mailbox audit logging is turned on by default in all organizations. This effort started in January 2019, and means that certain actions performed by mailbox owners, delegates, and admins are automatically logged. The corresponding mailbox audit records are available for admins to search in the mailbox audit log.

Mailboxes and shared mailboxes have actions assigned to them individually in order to audit the data the organization determines valuable at the mailbox level.

The recommended state is AuditEnabled to True on all user mailboxes along with additional audit actions beyond the Microsoft defaults.

Note: Due to some differences in defaults for audit actions this recommendation is specific to users assigned an E5 license, or auditing addon license, only.

Rationale:

Whether it is for regulatory compliance or for tracking unauthorized configuration changes in Microsoft 365, enabling mailbox auditing and ensuring the proper mailbox actions are accounted for allows for Microsoft 365 teams to run security operations, forensics or general investigations on mailbox activities.

The following mailbox types ignore the organizational default and must have AuditEnabled set to True at the mailbox level in order to capture relevant audit data.

Resource Mailboxes

Public Folder Mailboxes

DiscoverySearch Mailbox

NOTE: Without advanced auditing (E5 function) the logs are limited to 90 days.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "To enable mailbox auditing for all user mailboxes using PowerShell:

Connect to Exchange Online using Connect-ExchangeOnline.

Run the following PowerShell script:

$AuditAdmin = @(
    'ApplyRecord', 'Copy', 'Create', 'FolderBind', 'HardDelete',
    'MailItemsAccessed', 'Move', 'MoveToDeletedItems', 'SendAs',
    'SendOnBehalf', 'Send', 'SoftDelete', 'Update', 'UpdateCalendarDelegation',

$MBX | Set-Mailbox -AuditEnabled $true '
-AuditLogAgeLimit 180 -AuditAdmin $AuditAdmin -AuditDelegate $AuditDelegate '
-AuditOwner $AuditOwner

Note: When running this script mailboxes without an E5 or Azure Audit Premium license applied will generate an error as they are not licensed for the additional actions which come default with E5.
