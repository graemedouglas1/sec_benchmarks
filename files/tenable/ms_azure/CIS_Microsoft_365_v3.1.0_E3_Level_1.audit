  description : "1.1.1 Ensure Administrative accounts are separate and cloud-only"
  info        : "Administrative accounts are special privileged accounts that could have varying levels of access to data, users, and settings. Regular user accounts should never be utilized for administrative tasks and care should be taken, in the case of a hybrid environment, to keep Administrative accounts separated from on-prem accounts. Administrative accounts should not have applications assigned so that they have no access to potentially vulnerable services (EX. email, Teams, SharePoint, etc.) and only access to perform tasks as needed for administrative purposes.

Ensure administrative accounts are licensed without attached applications and cloud-only.

Rationale:

Ensuring administrative accounts are cloud-only, without applications assigned to them will reduce the attack surface of high privileged identities in your environment. In order to participate in Microsoft 365 security services such as Identity Protection, PIM and Conditional Access an administrative account will need a license attached to it. Ensure that the license used does not include any applications with potentially vulnerable services by using either Microsoft Entra ID P1 or Microsoft Entra ID P2 for the cloud-only account with administrator roles.

In a hybrid environment, having separate accounts will help ensure that in the event of a breach in the cloud, that the breach does not affect the on-prem environment and vice versa.

Impact:

Administrative users will have to switch accounts and utilizing login/logout functionality when performing administrative tasks, as well as not benefiting from SSO.

Note: Alerts will be sent to the TenantAdmins, including Global Administrators, by default. To ensure proper receipt, configure alerts to be sent to security or operations staff with valid email addresses or a security operations center. Otherwise, after adoption of this recommendation, alerts sent to TenantAdmins may go unreceived due to the lack of an application-based license assigned to the Global Administrator accounts.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  description : "1.1.2 Ensure two emergency access accounts have been defined"
  info        : "Emergency access or 'break glass' accounts are limited for emergency scenarios where normal administrative accounts are unavailable. They are not assigned to a specific user and will have a combination of physical and technical controls to prevent them from being accessed outside a true emergency. These emergencies could be due to several things, including:

Technical failures of a cellular provider or Microsoft related service such as MFA.

The last remaining Global Administrator account is inaccessible.

Ensure two Emergency Access accounts have been defined.

Note: Microsoft provides several recommendations for these accounts and how to configure them. For more information on this, please refer to the references section. The CIS Benchmark outlines the more critical things to consider.

Rationale:

In various situations, an organization may require the use of a break glass account to gain emergency access. In the event of losing access to administrative functions, an organization may experience a significant loss in its ability to provide support, lose insight into its security posture, and potentially suffer financial losses.

Impact:

If care is not taken in properly implementing an emergency access account this could weaken security posture. Microsoft recommends to exclude at least one of these accounts from all conditional access rules therefore passwords must have sufficient entropy and length to protect against random guesses. FIDO2 security keys may be used instead of a password for secure passwordless solution.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Step 1 - Create two emergency access accounts:

Navigate to Microsoft 365 admin center https://admin.microsoft.com

Expand Users > Active Users

Click Add user and create a new user with this criteria:

Name the account in a way that does NOT identify it with a particular person.

Assign the account to the default .onmicrosoft.com domain and not the organization's.

The password must be at least 16 characters and generated randomly.

Do not assign a license.

Assign the user the Global Administrator role.

Repeat the above steps for the second account.

Step 2 - Exclude at least one account from conditional access policies:

Navigate Microsoft Entra admin center https://entra.microsoft.com/

Expand Protection > Conditional Access.

Inspect the conditional access policies.

For each rule add an exclusion for at least one of the emergency access accounts.

Users > Exclude > Users and groups and select one emergency access account.

Step 3 - Ensure the necessary procedures and policies are in place:

In order for accounts to be effectively used in a break glass situation the proper policies and procedures must be authorized and distributed by senior management.

FIDO2 Security Keys, if used, should be locked in a secure separate fireproof location.

Passwords should be at least 16 characters, randomly generated and MAY be separated in multiple pieces to be joined on emergency.

Note: Additional suggestions for emergency account management:

Create access reviews for these users.

Exclude users from conditional access rules.

Warning: If CA (conditional access) exclusion is managed by a group, this group should be added to PIM for groups (licensing required) or be created as a role-assignable group. If it is a regular security group, then users with the Group Administrators role are able to bypass CA entirely.

Additionally, there should be no more than four global admins set for any tenant. Ideally global administrators will have no licenses assigned to them.

Rationale:

If there is only one global tenant administrator, he or she can perform malicious activity without the possibility of being discovered by another admin. If there are numerous global tenant administrators, the more likely it is that one of their accounts will be successfully breached by an external attacker.

Impact:

The potential impact associated with ensuring compliance with this requirement is dependent upon the current number of global administrators configured in the tenant. If there is only one global administrator in a tenant, an additional global administrator will need to be identified and configured. If there are more than four global administrators, a review of role requirements for current global administrators will be required to identify which of the users require global administrator access."

Users with permissions to the group mailbox can send as or send on behalf of the mailbox email address if the administrator has given that user permissions to do that. This is particularly useful for help and support mailboxes because users can send emails from 'Contoso Support' or 'Building A Reception Desk.'

Shared mailboxes are created with a corresponding user account using a system generated password that is unknown at the time of creation.

The recommended state is Sign in blocked for Shared mailboxes.

Rationale:

The intent of the shared mailbox is the only allow delegated access from other mailboxes. An admin could reset the password, or an attacker could potentially gain access to the shared mailbox allowing the direct sign-in to the shared mailbox and subsequently the sending of email from a sender that does not have a unique identity.

Rationale:

Organizations such as NIST and Microsoft have updated their password policy recommendations to not arbitrarily require users to change their passwords after a specific amount of time, unless there is evidence that the password is compromised, or the user forgot it. They suggest this even for single factor (Password Only) use cases, with a reasoning that forcing arbitrary password changes on users actually make the passwords less secure. Other recommendations within this Benchmark suggest the use of MFA authentication for at least critical accounts (at minimum), which makes password expiration even less useful as well as password protection for Entra ID.

Impact:

When setting passwords not to expire it is important to have other controls in place to supplement this setting. See below for related recommendations and user guidance.

Ban common passwords.

Educate users to not reuse organization passwords anywhere else.

DKIM lets an organization add a digital signature to outbound email messages in the message header. When DKIM is configured, the organization authorizes it's domain to associate, or sign, its name to an email message using cryptographic authentication. Email systems that get email from this domain can use a digital signature to help verify whether incoming email is legitimate.

Use of DKIM in addition to SPF and DMARC to help prevent malicious actors using spoofing techniques from sending messages that look like they are coming from your domain.

By enabling DKIM with Office 365, messages that are sent from Exchange Online will be cryptographically signed. This will allow the receiving email system to validate that the messages were generated by a server that the organization authorized and not being spoofed.

Host name:selector2._domainkey
Points to address or value:selector2-<domainGUID>._domainkey.<initialDomain>

For Office 365, the selectors will always be selector1 or selector2.
domainGUID is the same as the domainGUID in the customized MX record for your custom domain that appears before mail.protection.outlook.com. For example, in the following MX record for the domain contoso.com, the domainGUID is contoso-com:

contoso.com.  3600  IN  MX   5 contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com

The initial domain is the domain that you used when you signed up for Office 365. Initial domains always end in on microsoft.com.

  info           : "Security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID make it easier to be secure and help protect the organization. Security defaults contain preconfigured security settings for common attacks.

By default, Microsoft enables security defaults. The goal is to ensure that all organizations have a basic level of security enabled. The security default setting is manipulated in the Azure Portal.

The use of security defaults, however, will prohibit custom settings which are being set with more advanced settings from this benchmark.

Rationale:

Security defaults provide secure default settings that are managed on behalf of organizations to keep customers safe until they are ready to manage their own identity security settings.

For example, doing the following:

Requiring all users and admins to register for MFA.

Challenging users with MFA - mostly when they show up on a new device or app, but more often for critical roles and tasks.

Disabling authentication from legacy authentication clients, which can't do MFA.

Impact:

The potential impact associated with disabling of Security Defaults is dependent upon the security controls implemented in the environment. It is likely that most organizations disabling Security Defaults plan to implement equivalent controls to replace Security Defaults.

It may be necessary to check settings in other Microsoft products, such as Azure, to ensure settings and functionality are as expected when disabling security defaults for MS365."

Warning: It is recommended not to disable security defaults until you are ready to implement conditional access rules in the benchmark.

It was introduced in earlier versions of Office 365, prior to the more comprehensive implementation of Conditional Access (CA).

Rationale:

Both security defaults and conditional access with security defaults turned off are not compatible with per-user multi-factor authentication (MFA), which can lead to undesirable user authentication states. The CIS Microsoft 365 Benchmark explicitly employs Conditional Access for MFA as an enhancement over security defaults and as a replacement for the outdated per-user MFA. To ensure a consistent authentication state disable per-user MFA on all accounts.

Impact:

Accounts using per-user MFA will need to be migrated to use CA.

Prior to disabling per-user MFA the organization must be prepared to implement conditional access MFA to avoid security gaps and allow for a smooth transition. This will help ensure relevant accounts are covered by MFA during the change phase from disabling per-user MFA to enabling CA MFA. Section 5.2.2 in this document covers creating of a CA rule for both administrators and all users in the tenant.

  info           : "Entra ID supports the most widely used authentication and authorization protocols including legacy authentication. This authentication pattern includes basic authentication, a widely used industry-standard method for collecting username and password information.

The following messaging protocols support legacy authentication:

Authenticated SMTP - Used to send authenticated email messages.

Autodiscover - Used by Outlook and EAS clients to find and connect to mailboxes in Exchange Online.

Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) - Used to connect to mailboxes in Exchange Online.

Exchange Online PowerShell - Used to connect to Exchange Online with remote PowerShell. If you block Basic authentication for Exchange Online PowerShell, you need to use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module to connect. For instructions, see Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell using multifactor authentication.

Exchange Web Services (EWS) - A programming interface that's used by Outlook, Outlook for Mac, and third-party apps.

IMAP4 - Used by IMAP email clients.

MAPI over HTTP (MAPI/HTTP) - Primary mailbox access protocol used by Outlook 2010 SP2 and later.

Offline Address Book (OAB) - A copy of address list collections that are downloaded and used by Outlook.

Outlook Anywhere (RPC over HTTP) - Legacy mailbox access protocol supported by all current Outlook versions.

POP3 - Used by POP email clients.

Reporting Web Services - Used to retrieve report data in Exchange Online.

Universal Outlook - Used by the Mail and Calendar app for Windows 10.

Other clients - Other protocols identified as utilizing legacy authentication.

Rationale:

Legacy authentication protocols do not support multi-factor authentication. These protocols are often used by attackers because of this deficiency. Blocking legacy authentication makes it harder for attackers to gain access.

NOTE: As of October 2022 Microsoft began disabling basic authentication in all tenants, except for those who requested special exceptions it should no longer be available in most tenants beyond Dec 31, 2022. Despite this CIS recommends the CA policy to remain in place to act as a defense in depth measure.

Impact:

Enabling this setting will prevent users from connecting with older versions of Office, ActiveSync or using protocols like IMAP, POP or SMTP and may require upgrades to older versions of Office, and use of mobile mail clients that support modern authentication.

This will also cause multifunction devices such as printers from using scan to e-mail function if they are using a legacy authentication method. Microsoft has mail flow best practices in the link below which can be used to configure a MFP to work with modern authentication:

  info        : "When a Conditional Access policy targets the Microsoft Admin Portals cloud app, the policy is enforced for tokens issued to application IDs of the following Microsoft administrative portals:

Azure portal

Exchange admin center

Microsoft 365 admin center

Microsoft 365 Defender portal

Microsoft Entra admin center

Microsoft Intune admin center

Microsoft Purview compliance portal

Power Platform admin center

SharePoint admin center

Microsoft Teams admin center

Microsoft Admin Portals should be restricted to specific pre-determined administrative roles.

Rationale:

By default, users can sign into the various portals but are restricted by what they can view. Blocking sign-in to Microsoft Admin Portals enhances security of sensitive data by restricting access to privileged users. This mitigates potential exposure due to administrative errors or software vulnerabilities introduced by a CSP, as well as acting as a defense in depth measure against security breaches.

Impact:

PIM functionality will be impacted unless non-privileged users are first assigned to a permanent group or role that is excluded from this policy. When attempting to checkout a role in the Entra ID PIM area they will receive the message 'You don't have access to this Your sign-in was successful but you don't have permission to access this resource.'

Require number matching for push notifications

Show application name in push and passwordless notifications

Show geographic location in push and passwordless notifications

NOTE: On February 27, 2023 Microsoft started enforcing number matching tenant-wide for all users using Microsoft Authenticator.

Rationale:

As the use of strong authentication has become more widespread, attackers have started to exploit the tendency of users to experience 'MFA fatigue.' This occurs when users are repeatedly asked to provide additional forms of identification, leading them to eventually approve requests without fully verifying the source. To counteract this, number matching can be employed to ensure the security of the authentication process. With this method, users are prompted to confirm a number displayed on their original device and enter it into the device being used for MFA. Additionally, other information such as geolocation and application details are displayed to enhance the end user's awareness. Among these 3 options, number matching provides the strongest net security gain.

Impact:

Additional interaction will be required by end users using number matching as opposed to simply pressing 'Approve' for login attempts.

An adversary may employ what is called a 'mangler' to create permutations of these specific words in an attempt to crack passwords or hashes making it easier to reach their goal.

Impact:

If a custom banned password list includes too many common dictionary words, or short words that are part of compound words, then perfectly secure passwords may be blocked. The organization should consider a balance between security and usability when creating a list.

  info        : "When configuring a user or computer account to bypass mailbox audit logging, the system will not record any access, or actions performed by the said user or computer account on any mailbox. Administratively this was introduced to reduce the volume of entries in the mailbox audit logs on trusted user or computer accounts.

Ensure AuditBypassEnabled is not enabled on accounts without a written exception.

Rationale:

If a mailbox audit bypass association is added for an account, the account can access any mailbox in the organization to which it has been assigned access permissions, without generating any mailbox audit logging entries for such access or recording any actions taken, such as message deletions.

Enabling this parameter, whether intentionally or unintentionally, could allow insiders or malicious actors to conceal their activity on specific mailboxes. Ensuring proper logging of user actions and mailbox operations in the audit log will enable comprehensive incident response and forensics.

Impact:

None - this is the default behavior.

This is achieved by presenting a new tag on emails called 'External' (the string is localized based on the client language setting) and exposing related user interface at the top of the message reading view to see and verify the real sender's email address.

Once this feature is enabled via PowerShell, it might take 24-48 hours for users to start seeing the External sender tag in email messages received from external sources (outside of your organization), providing their Outlook version supports it.

The recommended state is ExternalInOutlook set to Enabled True

Note: Mail flow rules are often used by Exchange administrators to accomplish the External email tagging by appending a tag to the front of a subject line. There are limitations to this outlined here. The preferred method in the CIS Benchmark is to use the native experience.

Rationale:

Tagging emails from external senders helps to inform end users about the origin of the email. This can allow them to proceed with more caution and make informed decisions when it comes to identifying spam or phishing emails.

Note: Existing emails in a user's inbox from external senders are not tagged retroactively.

Impact:

Mail flow rules using external tagging will need to be disabled before enabling this to avoid duplicate [External] tags.

  description    : "7.2.3 Ensure external content sharing is restricted"
  info           : "The external sharing settings govern sharing for the organization overall. Each site has its own sharing setting that can be set independently, though it must be at the same or more restrictive setting as the organization.

The new and existing guests option requires people who have received invitations to sign in with their work or school account (if their organization uses Microsoft 365) or a Microsoft account, or to provide a code to verify their identity. Users can share with guests already in your organization's directory, and they can send invitations to people who will be added to the directory if they sign in.

The recommended state is New and existing guests or less permissive.

Rationale:

Forcing guest authentication on the organization's tenant enables the implementation of controls and oversight over external file sharing. When a guest is registered with the organization, they now have an identity which can be accounted for. This identity can also have other restrictions applied to it through group membership and conditional access rules.

Impact:

When using B2B integration, Entra ID external collaboration settings, such as guest invite settings and collaboration restrictions apply."

Note #2: Skype for business is deprecated as of July 31, 2021, although these settings may still be valid for a period of time. See the link in the reference section for more information.

Rationale:

Allowing users to communicate with Skype or Teams users outside of an organization presents a potential security threat as external users can interact with organization users over Skype for Business or Teams. While legitimate, productivity-improving scenarios exist, they are outweighed by the risk of data loss, phishing, and social engineering attacks against organization users via Teams.

Some real-world attacks and exploits delivered via Teams over external access channels include:

DarkGate malware

Social engineering / Phishing attacks by 'Midnight Blizzard'

GIFShell

Username enumeration

Impact:

The impact of disabling external access to Teams and Skype for an organization is highly dependent on current usage practices. If users infrequently communicate with external parties using these channels, the impact is likely to be minimal. However, if users regularly use Teams and Skype for client communication, the impact could be significant. Therefore, before disabling external access, users should be notified, and alternate communication mechanisms should be identified to ensure continuity of communication.

  description : "8.6.1 Ensure users can report security concerns in Teams"
  info        : "User reporting settings allow a user to report a message as malicious for further analysis. This recommendation is composed of 3 different settings and all be configured to pass:

In the Teams admin center: On by default and controls whether users are able to report messages from Teams. When this setting is turned off, users can't report messages within Teams, so the corresponding setting in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal is irrelevant.

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal: On by default for new tenants. Existing tenants need to enable it. If user reporting of messages is turned on in the Teams admin center, it also needs to be turned on the Defender portal for user reported messages to show up correctly on the User reported tab on the Submissions page.

Defender - Report message destinations: This applies to more than just Microsoft Teams and allows for an organization to keep their reports contained. Due to how the parameters are configured on the backend it is included in this assessment as a requirement.

Rationale:

Users will be able to more quickly and systematically alert administrators of suspicious malicious messages within Teams. The content of these messages may be sensitive in nature and therefore should be kept within the organization and not shared with Microsoft without first consulting company policy.

Note:

The reported message remains visible to the user in the Teams client.

Users can report the same message multiple times.

The message sender isn't notified that messages were reported.

Impact:

Enabling message reporting has an impact beyond just addressing security concerns. When users of the platform report a message, the content could include messages that are threatening or harassing in nature, possibly stemming from colleagues.

Due to this the security staff responsible for reviewing and acting on these reports should be equipped with the skills to discern and appropriately direct such messages to the relevant departments, such as Human Resources (HR).

This functionality generates a publicly reachable web link that doesn't necessitate authentication or the need to be an AAD user in order to access and view it.

The recommended state is Enabled for a subset of the organization or Disabled.

Rationale:

When using Publish to Web anyone on the Internet can view a published report or visual. Viewing requires no authentication. It includes viewing detail-level data that your reports aggregate. By disabling the feature, restricting access to certain users and allowing existing embed codes organizations can mitigate the exposure of confidential or proprietary information.

Impact:

Depending on the organization's utilization administrators may experience more overhead managing embed codes, and requests.

The recommended state is Enabled or Enabled for a subset of the organization.

Note: Sensitivity labels and protection are only applied to files exported to Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF files, that are controlled by 'Export to Excel' and 'Export reports as PowerPoint presentation or PDF documents' settings. All other export and sharing options do not support the application of sensitivity labels and protection.

Note 2: There are some prerequisite steps that need to be completed in order to fully utilize labeling. See here.

Rationale:

Establishing data classifications and affixing labels to data at creation enables organizations to discern the data's criticality, sensitivity, and value. This initial identification enables the implementation of appropriate protective measures, utilizing technologies like Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to avert inadvertent exposure and enforcing access controls to safeguard against unauthorized access.

This practice can also promote user awareness and responsibility in regard to the nature of the data they interact with. Which in turn can foster awareness in other areas of data management across the organization.

There are 3 options that can be selected when creating a shareable link:

People in your organization

People with existing access

Specific people

This setting solely deals with restrictions to People in the organization. External users by default are not included in any of these categories, and therefore cannot use any of these links regardless of the state of this setting.

The recommended state is Enabled for a subset of the organization or Disabled.

Rationale:

While external users are unable to utilize shareable links, disabling or restricting this feature ensures that a user cannot generate a link accessible by individuals within the same organization who lack the necessary clearance to the shared data. For example, a member of Human Resources intends to share sensitive information with a particular employee or another colleague within their department. The owner would be prompted to specify either People with existing access or Specific people when generating the link requiring the person clicking the link to pass a first layer access control list. This measure along with proper file and folder permissions can help prevent unintended access and potential information leakage.

Impact:

If the setting is Enabled then only specific people in the organization would be allowed to create general links viewable by the entire organization.
