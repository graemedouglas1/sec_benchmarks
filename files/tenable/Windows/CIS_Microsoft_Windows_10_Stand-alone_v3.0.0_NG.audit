Turn on Microsoft Defender Application Guard in Managed Mode

Impact:

Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be turned on for Microsoft Edge.

Note: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires the

Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) (SharedAccess)

service in order to operate, so an exception to disabling this service (see Section 5 in the CIS Microsoft Windows 10 benchmark only) will be required if choosing to enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard."

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.

Note #3: If implementing Virtualization Based Security (in Microsoft Defender Application Guard) with the Next Generation Windows Security (NGWS) profile, the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) (SharedAccess) service must not be Disabled (from Section 5).

Note #4: If the Level 2 recommendation to configure

Log on as a service

(from Section 2.2) is implemented, the additional security principal WDAGUtilityAccount must also be granted that User Right Assignment in order for Virtualization Based Security (in Microsoft Defender Application Guard) with the Next Generation Windows Security (NGWS) profile to function.

Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system."
