Note: A high-value IT resource is defined as any IT resource whose purpose is considered critical to the organization or whose loss or compromise would cause a significant impact on the organization.

Note: Sensitive business/mission service is any business or mission service that needs additional protection from higher-risk IT services based on the nature of the function it provides; sensitivity of the data it consumes, processes, or stores; or criticality to the operation of the organization.

High-value IT resources are the most important and critical IT resources within an organization. They contain the most sensitive data in an organization, perform the most critical tasks of an organization, or have access to and can control all or nearly all IT resources within an organization.

Some IT resources, by the nature of the function they perform, should always be considered high value and should be remotely administered only via a PAW. The IT resources listed above are in this category.

Note: If using the Microsoft scripts, after running the scripts, PAW Users Tier 0, PAW Users Tier 1, and PAW Users Tier 2 groups may need to be created under Admin/Tier 0/Groups, Admin/Tier 1/Groups, and Admin/Tier 2/Groups, respectively.

Set up administrative accounts for each assigned administrator for high-value IT resources.

Based on the list of high-value IT resources with assigned administrative tier level, move Tier 0-2 administrative accounts to the appropriate Organizational Units and add the appropriate members to the relevant groups. Make sure each account and group has been assigned to one and only one tier.

Note: Authorized exception - It is noted that administrators will need access to non-administrative functions, such as email and the Internet, but a PAW must not be used for these activities. For sites that are constrained in the number of available workstations, an acceptable approach is to install the non-administrative services on a separate virtual machine (VM) on the workstation where the PAW service is installed. The VM will provide acceptable isolation between high-value administrative management accounts and non-administrative services.
