Earlier versions of Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. (Access 2007)  By default, when users create new database files, Access saves them in the new Access format. Users can change this functionality by clicking the Office button, clicking Access Options, and then selecting a file format from the Default file format list. Disabling this setting allows users to choose from any of the available default file formats. If a new workbook is created in an earlier format, some users may not be unable to open or use the file, or they may choose a format that is less secure than the Access format."

By default, when users open an untrusted Access database that contains user-programmed executable components, Access opens the database with the components disabled and displays the Message Bar with a warning that database content has been disabled. Users can inspect the contents of the database, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking Options on the Message Bar and selecting the appropriate action. The default configuration can be changed so that users see a dialog box when they open an untrusted database with executable components. Users must then choose whether to enable or disable the components before working with the database. In these circumstances users frequently enable the components, even if they do not require them. Executable components can be used to launch an attack against a computer environment."
