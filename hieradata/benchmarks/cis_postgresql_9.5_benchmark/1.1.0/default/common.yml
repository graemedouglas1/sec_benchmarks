    title: '1.1 | Ensure packages are obtained from authorized repositories - manual'
    section: 'Installation and Patches'
    description: |
        When obtaining and installing software packages typically via  yum , its imperative that packages are sourced only from
        valid and authorized repositories. For PostgreSQL, a short list of valid repositories would include CentOS
        www.centos.org and the official PostgreSQL website yum.postgresql.org.
    remediation: |
        Alter the configured repositories so they only include valid and authorized sources of packages. Here is an example of
        adding an authorized repository: Install the PGDG repository RPM from  yum.postgresql.org
                                 $ rpm -ivh https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/9.5/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-

         The next recommendation "1.3 Ensure Installation of Community Packages" describes how to explicitly choose which
        version of PostgreSQL to install, regardless of Linux distribution association. Impact: If the PostgreSQL version
        shipped as part of the default binary installation associated with your Linux distribution satisfies your requirements,
        this may be adequate  for development and testing purposes . However,  for production instances  it's generally
        recommended to install the latest stable release of PostgreSQL.

         Note:  that your system's group number may not be 502. That's OK. Adding the  postgres  user to the newly created group

        The  logfilename  setting specifies the filename pattern for log files. The value for  logfilename  should match your
        organizations logging policy. The value is treated as a  strftime  pattern, so  escapes  can be used to specify
        timevarying filenames. The supported  escapes  are similar to those listed in the Open Groups  strftime  specification.
        If you specify a filename without escapes, you should plan to use a log rotation utility to avoid eventually filling the
        partition that contains  logdirectory . If there are any timezonedependent  escapes , the computation is done in the
        zone specified by  logtimezone . Also, the systems  strftime  is not used directly, so platformspecific nonstandard
        extensions do not work. If CSVformat output is enabled in  logdestination ,  .csv  will be appended to the log filename.
        If  logfilename  ends in  .log , the suffix is replaced instead.

    section: 'PostgreSQL Logging'
    description: |
        The  logfilemode  setting determines the file permissions for log files when  loggingcollector  is enabled. The
        parameter value is expected to be a numeric mode specification in the form accepted by the  chmod  and  umask  system
        calls. To use the customary octal format, the number must start with a  0  zero. The permissions should be set to allow
        only the necessary access to authorized personnel. In most cases the best setting is  0600 , so that only the server
        owner can read or write the log files. The other commonly useful setting is  0640 , allowing members of the owners group

    description: |
        Enabling the  logtruncateonrotation  setting when  loggingcollector  is enabled causes PostgreSQL to truncate overwrite
        existing log files with the same name during log rotation instead of appending to them. For example, using this setting
        in combination with a  logfilename  setting value like  postgresqlH.log  would result in generating 24 hourly log files
        and then cyclically overwriting them postgresql00.log postgresql01.log ... postgresql23.log
         Note  Truncation will occur  only  when a new file is being opened due to timebased rotation, not during server startup
        or sizebased rotation see later in this benchmark for sizebased rotation details.

        to: enable pgAudit as an extension in the  shared_preload_libraries  parameter indicate which classes of statements we
        want to log via the  pgaudit.log  parameter and, finally, restart the PostgreSQL service: $ vi ${PGDATA}/postgresql.conf
         Find the  shared_preload_libraries  entry, and add 'pgaudit' to it (preserving any existing entries):
        shared_preload_libraries = 'pgaudit'
                              OR
                              shared_preload_libraries = 'pgaudit,somethingelse'
         Now, add a new  pgaudit -specific entry: # for this example we are logging the ddl and write operations
        pgaudit.log='ddl,write'
         Restart the PostgreSQL server for changes to take affect: $ whoami root $ service postgresql-9.5 restart Stopping

        OK  ]
         Impact: Depending on settings, it is possible for pgAudit to generate an  enormous volume of logging . Be careful to
        determine exactly what needs to be audit logged in your environment to avoid logging too much.

        level. It is also quite common to permit login privileges to individuals on a PostgreSQL host who otherwise are not
        authorized to access the servers data cluster and files. Administering the PostgreSQL data cluster, as opposed to its
        data, is to be accomplished via a localhost login of a regular UNIX user account. Access to the  postgres  superuser
        account is restricted in such a manner as to interdict unauthorized access.  sudo  satisfies the requirements by

    remediation: |
        For demonstration purposes, the following example highlights the various issues one must consider and is just one of
        many methods that can be used to install and use a public SSH key. It is recommended that a configuration management
        tool, such as Puppet, be used as part of a larger, and automated, provisioning process where there are many DBAs
        authorized to administrate multiple servers. After creating your SSH public/private key pair, login as  root  on the
        PostgreSQL server and assign a temporary password to the  postgres  user account. Copy the SSH public key from your key
        pair to the PostgreSQL server. This step will prompt you for the temporary password you set above: Now that your SSH
        public key is in place, test that you can SSH to the PostgreSQL server  without being prompted for a password : Upon
        successful login without being prompted for a password, one can now lock the  postgres  account to prevent future logins
        via password: passwd -l postgres
         New public keys can be added by editing the  postgres  account's authorization file directly: Alternatively, another
        implementation would be to add the public key to one's own personal account on the remote host and then  sudo  into
        postgres . Added security is implied because you would need to supply your account password:

        With respect to PostgreSQL administrative SQL commands, only superusers should have elevated privileges. PostgreSQL
        regular, or application, users should not possess the ability to create roles, create new databases, manage replication,
        or perform any other action deemed privileged . Typically, regular users should only be granted the minimal set of
        privileges commensurate with managing the application DDL create table, create view, create index, etc. DML select,
        insert, update, delete Further, it has become best practice to create separate roles for DDL and DML. Given an
        application called payroll, one would create the following users payrollowner payrolluser Any DDL privileges would be
        granted to the payrollowner account only, while DML privileges would be given to the payrolluser account only. This
        prevents accidental creation/altering/dropping of database objects by application code that run as the payrolluser
        account.
    remediation: |
        If any regular or application users have been granted excessive administrative rights, those privileges should be
        removed immediately via the PostgreSQL  ALTER ROLE  SQL command. Using the same example above, the following SQL
        statements revoke all unnecessary elevated administrative privileges from the regular user  appuser : $ whoami postgres

        In certain situations, to provide required functionality, PostgreSQL needs to execute internal logic stored procedures,

        execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking the functionality
        applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by their organization.
        This is known as privilege elevation. Privilege elevation must be utilized only where necessary. Execute privileges for
        application functions should be restricted to authorized users only.
    remediation: |
        Where possible, revoke  SECURITY DEFINER  on PostgreSQL functions. To change a  SECURITY DEFINER  function to  SECURITY
        INVOKER , run the following SQL: $ whoami root $ sudo su - postgres $ psql -c "ALTER FUNCTION [functionname] SECURITY
        INVOKER;"
         If it is not possible to revoke  SECURITY DEFINER , ensure the function can be executed by only the accounts that
        absolutely need such functionality: REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION delete_customer(integer,boolean) FROM appreader; REVOKE
         Confirm that the  appreader  user may no longer execute the function: SELECT proname, proacl FROM pg_proc WHERE proname

    section: 'User Access and Authorization'
    description: |
        In addition to the SQLstandard privilege system available through  GRANT , tables can have row security policies that
        restrict, on a peruser basis, which individual rows can be returned by normal queries or inserted, updated, or deleted
        by data modification commands. This feature is also known as Row Level Security RLS. By default, tables do not have any
        policies, so if a user has access privileges to a table according to the SQL privilege system, all rows within it are
        equally available for querying or updating. Row security policies can be specific to commands, to roles, or to both. A
        policy can be specified to apply to  ALL  commands, or to any combination of  SELECT ,  INSERT ,  UPDATE , or  DELETE .
        Multiple roles can be assigned to a given policy, and normal role membership and inheritance rules apply. If you use RLS
        and apply restrictive policies to certain users, it is important that the  Bypass RLS  privilege not be granted to any
        unauthorized users. This privilege overrides RLSenabled tables and associated policies. Generally, only superusers and
        elevated users should possess this privilege.
    remediation: |
        Again, we are using the example from the PostgreSQL documentation using the example  passwd  table. We will create three
        database roles to illustrate the workings of RLS: postgres=# CREATE ROLE admin; CREATE ROLE postgres=# CREATE ROLE bob;
        CREATE ROLE postgres=# CREATE ROLE alice; CREATE ROLE
         Now, we will insert known data into the  passwd  table: postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES
        ('admin','xxx',0,0,'Admin','111-222-3333',null,'/root','/bin/dash'); INSERT 0 1 postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES
        ('bob','xxx',1,1,'Bob','123-456-7890',null,'/home/bob','/bin/zsh'); INSERT 0 1 postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES
        ('alice','xxx',2,1,'Alice','098-765-4321',null,'/home/alice','/bin/zsh'); INSERT 0 1
         And we will enable RLS on the table: postgres=# ALTER TABLE passwd ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE
         Now that RLS is enabled, we need to define one or more policies. Create the administrator policy and allow it access to
        all rows: postgres=# CREATE POLICY admin_all ON passwd TO admin USING (true) WITH CHECK (true); CREATE POLICY
         Create a policy for normal users to  view  all rows: postgres=# CREATE POLICY all_view ON passwd FOR SELECT USING
        (true); CREATE POLICY
         Create a policy for normal users that allows them to update only their own rows and to limit what values can be set for
        their login shell: postgres=# CREATE POLICY user_mod ON passwd FOR UPDATE   USING (current_user = user_name)   WITH
        CHECK (     current_user = user_name AND     shell IN ('/bin/bash','/bin/sh','/bin/dash','/bin/zsh','/bin/tcsh')   );
        CREATE POLICY
         Grant all the normal rights on the table to the  admin  user: postgres=# GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON passwd

         Grant update to only the sensitive columns: postgres=# GRANT UPDATE   (pwhash, real_name, home_phone, extra_info,
        shell)   ON passwd TO public; GRANT
         Ensure that no one has been granted  Bypass RLS  inadvertantly, by running the  psql  display command  \du+ . If
        unauthorized users do have  Bypass RLS  granted then resolve this using the  ALTER ROLE
                              <user>
                              NOBYPASSRLS;  command. You can now verify that 'admin', 'bob', and 'alice' are properly restricted
        by querying the  passwd  table as each of these roles.

         Now that  set_user  is installed, we need to tell PostgreSQL to load its library: $ whoami root $ vi
        ~postgres/9.5/data/postgresql.conf # load set_user libs before anything else shared_preload_libraries = 'set_user,
        other_libs' $ service postgresql-9.5 restart Stopping postgresql-9.5 service:                           [  OK  ]
        Starting postgresql-9.5 service:                           [  OK  ]
         And now, we can install the extension from with SQL: postgres=# select * from pg_available_extensions where name =
        'set_user';    name   | default_version | installed_version |                  comment
        ----------+-----------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------  set_user | 1.6
        |                   | similar to SET ROLE but with added logging (1 row)
                              postgres=# create extension set_user; CREATE EXTENSION postgres=# select * from
        pg_available_extensions where name = 'set_user';    name   | default_version | installed_version |
        comment ----------+-----------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------  set_user | 1.6
        | 1.6               | similar to SET ROLE but with added logging (1 row)
         Now, we use  GRANT  to configure each DBA role to allow it to use the  set_user  functions. In the example below, we
        will configure my db user  doug . (You would do this for each DBA's normal user role.) postgres=# grant execute on
        function set_user(text) to doug; GRANT postgres=# grant execute on function set_user_u(text) to doug; GRANT
         Connect to PostgreSQL as yourself and verify it works as expected: $ whoami psql $ psql -U doug -d postgres postgres=>
        select set_user('postgres'); ERROR:  switching to superuser not allowed HINT:  Use 'set_user_u' to escalate. postgres=>
        select set_user_u('postgres');  set_user_u ------------  OK (1 row)
                              postgres=# select current_user, session_user;  current_user | session_user
        --------------+--------------  postgres     | doug (1 row)
                              postgres=# select reset_user();  reset_user ------------  OK (1 row)
                              postgres=> select current_user, session_user;  current_user | session_user
        --------------+--------------  doug         | doug (1 row)
         Once all DBA's normal user accounts have been  GRANT ed permission, revoke the ability to login as the  postgres
        (superuser) user: postgres=# alter user postgres NOLOGIN; ALTER ROLE
         Which results in: $ psql psql: FATAL:  role "postgres" is not permitted to log in $ psql -U doug -d postgres psql
        (9.5.15)
         Make sure there are no other roles that are superuser's and can still login: postgres=# SELECT rolname FROM pg_authid
        WHERE rolsuper and rolcanlogin;  rolname --------- (0 rows)
         Verify there are no unprivileged roles that can login directly that are granted a superuser role even if it is multiple
        layers removed: postgres=# DROP VIEW IF EXISTS roletree; NOTICE:  view "roletree" does not exist, skipping DROP VIEW
        postgres=# CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW roletree AS postgres-# WITH RECURSIVE postgres-# roltree AS ( postgres(#   SELECT
        u.rolname AS rolname, postgres(#          u.oid AS roloid, postgres(#          u.rolcanlogin, postgres(#

        ---------+--------+-------------+----------+------------ (0 rows)
         If any roles are identified by this query, use  REVOKE  to correct. Impact: Much like the venerable  sudo  does for the
        OS,  set_user  manages superuser access for PostgreSQL. Complete configuration of  set_user  is documented at the
        extension's  website  and should be reviewed to ensure the logging entries that your organization cares about are
        properly configured. Note that some external tools assume they can connect as the  postgres  user by default and this is
        no longer true. You may find some tools need different options, reconfigured, or even abandoned to compensate for this.

    title: '5.1 | Ensure login via local UNIX Domain Socket is configured correctly - manual'
    section: 'Connection and Login'
    description: |
        A remote host login, via ssh, is arguably the most secure means of remotely accessing and administering the PostgreSQL
        server. Connecting with the  psql  client, via UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS, using the  peer  authentication method is the most
        secure mechanism available for local connections. Provided a database user account of the same name of the UNIX account
        has already been defined in the database, even ordinary user accounts can access the cluster in a similarly highly
        secure manner.
    remediation: |
        Creation of a database account that matches the local account allows PEER authentication: $ psql -c "CREATE ROLE user1
        WITH LOGIN;" CREATE ROLE
         Execute the following as the UNIX user account, the default authentication rules should now permit the login: $ su -
        user1 $ whoami user1 $ psql -d postgres psql (9.5.15) Type "help" for help.
                              postgres=>
         As per the host-based authentication rules in  $PGDATA/pg_hba.conf , all login attempts via UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS are
        processed on the line beginning with  local . This is the minimal rule that must be in place allowing PEER connections:
        # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD local   all             postgres
        peer
         More traditionally, a rule like the following would be used to allow any local PEER connection: # TYPE  DATABASE
        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD local   all             all                                     peer
         Once edited, the server process must reload the authentication file before it can take effect. Improperly configured
        rules cannot update i.e. the old rules remain in place. The PostgreSQL logs will report the outcome of the SIGHUP:
        postgres=# select pg_reload_conf();  pg_reload_conf ----------------  t (1 row)
         The following examples illustrate other possible configurations. The resultant "rule" of success/failure depends upon
        the first matching line: # allow postgres user logins
        # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD local   all             postgres

        A large number of authentication METHODs are available for hosts connecting using TCP/IP sockets, including trust reject
        md5 password gss sspi ident pam ldap radius cert METHODs  trust ,  password , and  ident  are  not  to be used for
        remote logins. METHOD  md5  is the most popular and can be used in both encrypted and unencrypted sessions. Use of the
        gss ,  sspi ,  pam ,  ldap ,  radius , and  cert  METHODs, while more secure than  md5 , are dependent upon the
        availability of external authenticating processes/services and thus are not covered in this benchmark.
    remediation: |
        Confirm a login attempt has been made by looking for a logged error message detailing the nature of the authenticating
        failure. In the case of failed login attempts, whether encrypted or unencrypted, check the following: The server should
        be sitting on a port exposed to the remote connecting host i.e. NOT ip address 127.0.0.1
         listen_addresses = '*'    ``` * An authenticating rule must exist in the file `pg_hba.conf`
                                    This example permits only encrypted sessions for the `postgres` role and denies all
        unencrypted session for the `postgres` role:

                               # TYPE    DATABASE           USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

         hostnossl  all             postgres         0.0.0.0/0                 reject
         The following examples illustrate other possible configurations. The resultant "rule" of success/failure depends upon

        In order to serve multiple clients efficiently, the PostgreSQL server launches a new backend process for each client.
        The runtime parameters in this benchmark section are controlled by the backend process. The servers performance, in the
        form of slow queries causing a denial of service, and the RDBMs auditing abilities for determining root cause analysis
        can be compromised via these parameters.
    remediation: |
        Once detected, the unauthorized/undesired change can be corrected by altering the configuration file and executing a
        server restart. In the case where the parameter has been on the command line invocation of  pg_ctl  the  restart
        invocation is insufficient and an explicit  stop  and  start  must instead be made. Query the view  pg_settings  and
        compare with previous query outputs for any changes. Review configuration files  postgresql.conf  and
        postgresql.auto.conf  and compare them with previously archived file copies for any changes. Examine the process output
        and look for parameters that were used at server startup:
         ps aux | grep -E '[p]ostgres|[p]ostmaster'

                              Impact: All changes made on this level will affect the overall behavior of the server. These
        changes can only be affected by a server restart after the parameters have been altered in the configuration files.

    remediation: |
        For this example, and ease of illustration, we will be using a self-signed certificate for the server generated via
        openssl , and the PostgreSQL defaults for file naming and location in the PostgreSQL  $PGDATA  directory. $ whoami
        postgres $ # create new certificate and enter details at prompts $ openssl req -new -text -out server.req Generating a
        2048 bit RSA private key .....................+++ ..................................................................+++

        to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. What you are about to enter is
        what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank For some fields
        there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank. ----- Country Name (2 letter code)
        [XX]:US State or Province Name (full name) []:Ohio Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Columbus Organization Name
        (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Me Inc Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT Common Name (eg, your name or
        your server's hostname) []:my.me.inc Email Address []:me@meinc.com
                              Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request A challenge
        password []: An optional company name []:
                              $ # remove passphrase (required for automatic server start up) $ openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out
        server.key && rm privkey.pem Enter pass phrase for privkey.pem: writing RSA key
                              $ # modify certificate to self signed, generate .key and .crt files $ openssl req -x509 -in
        server.req -text -key server.key -out server.crt
                              $ # copy .key and .crt files to appropriate location, here default $PGDATA $ cp server.key
        server.crt $PGDATA
                              $ # restrict file mode for server.key $ chmod og-rwx server.key
         Edit the PostgreSQL configuration file  postgresql.conf  to ensure the following items are set. Again, we are using
        defaults. Note that altering these parameters will require restarting the cluster. # (change requires restart) ssl = on
                              # allowed SSL ciphers ssl_ciphers = 'HIGH:MEDIUM:+3DES:!aNULL'
                              # (change requires restart) ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
                              # (change requires restart) ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
                              password_encryption = on
         Finally, restart PostgreSQL and confirm  ssl  using commands outlined in Audit Procedures: postgres=# show ssl;  ssl
        -----  on (1 row)
         Impact: A self-signed certificate can be used for testing, but a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA)
        (either one of the global CAs or a local one) should be used in production so that clients can verify the server's
        identity. If all the database clients are local to the organization, using a local CA is recommended. To ultimately
        enable and enforce  ssl  authentication for the server, appropriate  hostssl  records must be added to the  pg_hba.conf
        file. Be sure to  reload  PostgreSQL after any changes (restart not required). Note:  The  hostssl  record matches
        connection attempts made using TCP/IP, but  only  when the connection is made with SSL encryption. The  host  record
        matches attempts made using TCP/IP, but allows both SSL and non-SSL connections. The  hostnossl  record matches attempts
        made using TCP/IP, but only those  without  SSL.  Care should be taken to enforce SSL as appropriate.

        information system components.
    remediation: |
        The  pgcrypto  extension is included with the PostgreSQL 'contrib' package. Although included, it needs to be created in
        the database. As the database administrator, run the following: postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto; CREATE EXTENSION

         Impact: When considering or undertaking any form of encryption, it is critical to understand the state of the encrypted
        data at all stages of the data lifecycle. The use of  pgcrypto  ensures that the data at rest in the tables (and
        therefore on disk) is encrypted, but for the data to be accessed by any users or applications, said users/applications
        will, by necessity, have access to the encrypt and decrypt keys and the data in question will be encrypted/decrypted in
        memory and then transferred to/from the user/application in that form.

    description: |
        A base backup is a copy of the PRIMARY hosts data cluster PGDATA and is used to create STANDBY hosts and for Point In
        Time Recovery PITR mechanisms. Base backups should be copied across networks in a secure manner using an encrypted
        transport mechanism. CLI examples includes  scp ,  sftp  and  rsync e ssh . Alternatively, the CLI  cp  can be used with
        an SSLenabled implementation of an NFS mount point, or the PostgreSQL CLI  pgbasebackup  can be used. However, SSL
        encryption should be enabled on the server. Beware it is possible to use this utility without SSL encryption enabled.
    remediation: |
        There are two methods of creating base backups; manual and simple. The "manual" method explicitly first signals that a
        backup is about to start, then copies both the data cluster and WALs, using the appropriate tools/utilities, and finally
        signaling the PRIMARY host the copy process has finished and the backup has finished.  postgres=# SELECT
        pg_start_backup('my base backup');   pg_start_backup  -----------------   0/2000028  (1 row)
            # copy both the data cluster and     # all WALs generated during the process    # ex:    $ scp -rp $PGDATA
        user@dest:/path
          postgres=# SELECT pg_stop_backup();   pg_start_backup  -----------------   0/2000030  (1 row)

    title: '7.4 | Ensure WAL archiving is configured and functional'
    section: 'Replication'
    description: |
        Write Ahead Log WAL Archiving, or Log Shipping, is the process of sending transaction log files from the PRIMARY host
        either to one or more STANDBY hosts or to be archived on a remote storage device for later use, e.g.  PITR . There are
        several utilities that can copy WALs including, but not limited to,  cp ,  scp ,  sftp , and  rynsc . Basically, the
        server follows a set of runtime parameters which defines when the WAL should be copied using one of the aforementioned
        utilities.
    remediation: |
        Change parameters and restart the server as required. Note:  SSH public keys must be generated and installed as per
        industry standards.

    title: '8.1 | Ensure PostgreSQL configuration files are outside the data cluster'
    section: 'Special Configuration Considerations'
    description: |
        PostgreSQL configuration files within the data clusters directory tree can be changed by anyone logging into the data
        cluster as the superuser, i.e.  postgres . As a matter of default policy, configuration files such as  postgresql.conf ,
        pghba.conf , and  pgident , are placed in the data clusters directory,  PGDATA . PostgreSQL can be configured to
        relocate these files to locations outside the data cluster which cannot then be accessed by an ordinary superuser login
        session. Consideration should also be given to include directives these are cluster subdirectories where one can locate
        files containing additional configuration parameters. Include directives are meant to add more flexibility for unique
        installs or large network environments while maintaining order and consistent architectural design.
    remediation: |
        Follow these steps to remediate the configuration file locations and permissions: Determine appropriate locations for
        relocatable configuration files based on your organization's security policies. If necessary, relocate and/or rename
        configuration files outside of the data cluster. Ensure their file permissions are restricted as much as possible, i.e.
        only superuser read access. Change the settings accordingly in the  postgresql.conf  configuration file. Restart the
        database cluster for the changes to take effect.

        The PostgreSQL cluster is organized to carry out specific tasks in subdirectories. For the purposes of performance,
        reliability, and security these subdirectories should be relocated outside the data cluster.
    remediation: |
        Perform the following steps to remediate the subdirectory locations and permissions: Determine appropriate data, log,
        and tablespace directories and locations based on your organization's security policies. If necessary, relocate all
        listed directories outside the data cluster. Ensure file permissions are restricted as much as possible, i.e. only
        superuser read access. When directories are relocated to other partitions, ensure that they are of sufficient size to
        mitigate against excessive space utilization. Lastly, change the settings accordingly in the  postgresql.conf
        configuration file and restart the database cluster for changes to take effect.

    title: '8.3 | Ensure the backup and restore tool pgBackRest is installed and configured - manual'
    section: 'Special Configuration Considerations'
    description: |
        pgBackRest aims to be a simple, reliable backup and restore system that can seamlessly scale up to the largest databases
        and workloads. Instead of relying on traditional backup tools like  tar  and  rsync , pgBackRest implements all backup
        features internally and uses a custom protocol for communicating with remote systems. Removing reliance on  tar  and
        rsync  allows for better solutions to databasespecific backup challenges. The custom remote protocol allows for more
        flexibility and limits the types of connections that are required to perform a backup which increases security.
    remediation: |
        pgBackRest  is not installed nor configured for PostgreSQL by default, but instead is maintained as a GitHub project.
        Fortunately, it is a part of the PGDG repository and can be easily installed: $ whoami root $ yum -y install

         Once installed,  pgBackRest  must be configured for things like stanza name, backup location, retention policy,
        logging, etc. Please consult the  configuration guide . If employing  pgBackRest  for your backup/recovery solution,
        ensure the repository, base backups, and WAL archives are stored on a reliable file system separate from the database
        server. Further, the external storage system where backups resided should have limited access to only those system
        administrators as necessary. Finally, as with any backup/recovery solution, stringent testing must be conducted. A
        backup is only good if it can be restored successfully.

    title: '8.4 | Ensure miscellaneous configuration settings are correct - manual'
    section: 'Special Configuration Considerations'
    description: |
        This recommendation covers nonregular, special files, and dynamic libraries. PostgreSQL permits local logins via the
        UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET and, for the most part, anyone with a legitimate Unix login account can make the attempt. Limiting
        PostgreSQL login attempts can be made by relocating the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET to a subdirectory with restricted
        permissions. The creation and implementation of userdefined dynamic libraries is an extraordinary powerful capability.
        In the hands of an experienced DBA/programmer, it can significantly enhance the power and flexibility of the RDBMS. But
        new and unexpected behavior can also be assigned to the RDBMS, resulting in a very dangerous environment in what should
        otherwise be trusted.
    remediation: |
        Follow these steps to remediate the configuration: Determine permissions based on your organization's security policies.
        Relocate all files and ensure their permissions are restricted as much as possible, i.e. only superuser read access.
        Ensure all directories where these files are located have restricted permissions such that the superuser can read but
        not write. Lastly, change the settings accordingly in the  postgresql.conf  configuration file and restart the database
        cluster for changes to take effect.
