        security updates provided by the software vendor.
    remediation: |
        The automated CAM check for 3.4 requires both the download of updates and the installation of those updates to be
        automatic and without user intervention.  Therefore, it will fail even if automatic update downloads are on but the user
        can decide whether to install those updates. CAM is checking the following registry settings:
                              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate DisableWindowsUpdateAccess
        (Fail if this setting is set to 1)
                              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU NoAutoUpdate  (Fail if
        this setting is set to 1)
                              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU AUOptions  (Fail if this
        setting is not set to 4)
                           The AUOptions value can be set via local group policy as follows: Open the Local Group Policy Editor,
        navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Configure
        Automatic Updates.  Ensure that Enabled is selected, and Configure automatic updating is set to 4 – Auto download and
        schedule the install.  The other settings there (such as the specific schedule for updates) can be set as appropriate
        for your organization and are not assessed by CAM.    Similar settings are available at the Domain level as well.

    remediation: |
        Since Windows does not have default passwords, the automated CAM check for 4.2 focuses on the having "values consistent
        with administrative level accounts" portion of the sub-control.  CAM is checking for a required minimum password length.
        By default, the required minimum in CAM is 14 (which is consistent with the Windows Benchmark), but this setting can be
        adjusted in the assessor-cli.properties file as appropriate for your organization. The minimum password length can be

        For the CAM automated check for 6.2, CAM verifies that at least one sub-category of logging is turned on (but does not
        currently require specific sub-categories).  For recommended audit sub-categories, see section 17 of the appropriate
        Windows Benchmark. This should pass with a default Windows installation.  Logging sub-categories can be
        enabled/disabled: Open the Local Group Policy Editor, navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security
        Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies.  Click into the desired logging category, and

        CAM's check for 8.5 is divided into two separate checks - one for AutoRun and one for AutoPlay.  This is the AutoRun
        check. CAM is checking the following registry settings to see if at least one of them is set to disable AutoRun:
                              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer NoAutoRun  (Pass if

                              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer NoDriveTypeAutoRun

                              HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer NoDriveTypeAutoRun

                              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer NoDriveAutoRun
        (Pass if this setting is set to 0x3FFFFFF)
                              HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer NoDriveAutoRun
        (Pass if this setting is set to 0x3FFFFFF)
                              Note that while the Machine settings or Current User settings are accepted by CAM, the Machine
        settings are preferred because they would turn AutoRun off for all users on the machine.
                           AutoRun can be turned off via local group policy as follows: Open the Local Group Policy Editor,
        navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > AutoPlay Policies > Set the default
        behavior for AutoRun.  Ensure that Enabled is selected, and then select "Do not execute any autorun commands" in the

    remediation: |
        The automated CAM check for 15.7 ensures that any wireless connections detected for the machine are making use of CCMP
        (the Counter Mode CBCMAC Protocol, a mode of AES used for WLAN connections as discussed in IEEE 802.11i).  If no
        wireless connections are detected, this check will Pass.  For each wireless connection in Control Panel > All Control
        Panel Items > Network and Sharing Center, click on the linked name of that connection to open the Wi-Fi Status of the
        connection, and then click Wireless Properties.  In the Properties dialog box for that connection, click on the Security

    remediation: |
        The automated CAM check for 16.9 checks the last logon date for each of the enabled local machine accounts and verifies
        that they have been logged into within a specified timeframe.  If the account has never been logged into, this timeframe
        is applied to the last password set date instead.  By default, CAM uses 30 days for this timeframe, but this setting can
        be adjusted in the assessor-cli.properties file as appropriate for your organization. Ensure that any accounts not
        meeting the specified dormancy time frame are disabled.  The "net user" command can be used to identify last logon times
        for specific users.  Accounts can be deactivated either with the "net user" command or in Computer Management > System
        Tools > Local Users and Groups > Users .

    remediation: |
        The CAM automated check for 16.11 makes sure that the lock screen timeout does not exceed a maximum value and that the
        lock screen is enabled.  The default maximum timeout value for CAM is 900 seconds (15 minutes, which is consistent with
        the Windows Benchmark), but this setting can be adjusted in the assessor-cli.properties file as appropriate for your
        organization. The lock screen timeout value can be set via local group policy as follows: Open the Local Group Policy
        Editor, navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options >
        Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit .  This setting may require a reboot to take effect.
