         Impact: Implementing Cisco AAA is significantly disruptive as former access methods are immediately disabled.
        Therefore, before implementing Cisco AAA, the organization should carefully review and plan their authentication
        criteria (logins & passwords, challenges & responses, and token technologies), authorization methods, and accounting
        requirements.

        hostname(config)#line aux 0
        hostname(config-line)#no exec
                       Impact: Organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access by disabling the 'aux' port with the 'no

        Access lists control the transmission of packets on an interface, control Virtual Terminal Line VTY access, and restrict
        the contents of routing updates. The Cisco IOS software stops checking the extended access list after a match occurs.
    remediation: |
        Configure the VTY ACL that will be used to restrict management access to the device.
