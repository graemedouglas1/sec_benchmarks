         will cause Snap packages to fail.                   Snap
         application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike
        traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux
        distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's
        end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and
        can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.

    description: |
        The                  /tmp
         directory is a worldwritable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications.
        If an entry for                  /tmp
         exists in                  /etc/fstab
         it will take precedence over entries in systemd default unit file.               Note
         In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, entries in                  /etc/fstab
         may not take precedence.               /tmp
         can be configured to use                  tmpfs
        .               tmpfs
         puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able
        to swap unneeded pages out to swap space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via
        mount o remount
        .
        Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be shown as Shmem in
        /proc/meminfo
         and Shared in                  free
        . Notice that these counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using
        df
         and                  du
        .               tmpfs
         has three mount options for sizing               size
         The limit of allocated bytes for this                    tmpfs
         instance. The default is half of your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the machine will
        deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that memory.                 nrblocks
         The same as size, but in blocks of PAGESIZE.                 nrinodes
         The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or on a
        machine with highmem the number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower.
        These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size parameter also accepts a suffix
        to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM. The default, when neither                  size
         nor                  nrblocks
         is specified, is                  size50
        .
    remediation: |
        First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that                      /tmp
         will be mounted at boot time.                   # systemctl unmask tmp.mount

        For specific configuration requirements of the                      /tmp
         mount for your environment, modify                      /etc/fstab
        .
        Example of using                      tmpfs
         with specific mount options:                   tmpfs	/tmp	tmpfs     defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G  0
        0
         Note:
         the                      size=2G
         is an example of setting a specific size for                      tmpfs
        .                   Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or
        disk will vary depending on your environment: <device> /tmp    <fstype>    defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec   0 0
         Impact:
        By design files saved to                        /tmp
         should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system.                        tmpfs
         is ram based and all files stored to                        tmpfs
         will be lost when the system is rebooted.
        If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to                        /var/tmp
         not                        /tmp
        .
        Since the                        /tmp
         directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to
        tmpfs
         or a separate partition.
        Running out of                        /tmp
         space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where
        /tmp
         is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only
        creates a single                        /
         partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                        /tmp
         (as with                        tmpfs
        ) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.
        Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for                        /tmp
         from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than
        tmpfs
         which is RAM-based.

         configuration file:
        cat <<EOF
        set superusers="<username>"
        password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>

        entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will
        not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable to do so, the
        configuration files will have to be edited via a LiveCD or other means to fix the problem
        You can add                    --unrestricted
         to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password.  A password will still be required to edit
        menu items.

        Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis.
        Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute NX, while on Intel processors it is called Execute
        Disable XD. This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated
        whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32bit x86
        systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel
        for those platforms supports the feature. Note
         Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing this recommendation as this may
        prevent it from booting if these are not supported by your hardware
    remediation: |
        On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems: If necessary
        configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system. You may need to enable NX or XD support in your

        server The server directive specifies an NTP server which can be used as a time source. The clientserver relationship is
        strictly hierarchical a client might synchronize its system time to that of the server, but the servers system time will
        never be influenced by that of a client. This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple servers. The
        directive is immediately followed by either the name of the server, or its IP address. pool The syntax of this directive
        is similar to that for the server directive, except that it is used to specify a pool of NTP servers rather than a
        single NTP server. The pool name is expected to resolve to multiple addresses which might change over time. This
        directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple pools. All options valid in the server directive can be used in

         Access Control Commands             restrict address mask mask ippeerlimit int flag ...
        The                address
         argument expressed in dottedquad form is the address of a host or network.  Alternatively, the address argument can be
        a valid host DNS name.
        The                mask
         argument expressed in dottedquad form defaults to 255.255.255.255, meaning that the address is treated as the address
        of an individual host. A default entry address 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0 is always included and is always the first entry in
        the list.                Note
         the text string default, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry.
        The                ippeerlimit
         directive limits the number of peer requests for each IP to int, where a value of 1 means unlimited, the current
        default. A value of 0 means none. There would usually be at most 1 peering request per IP, but if the remote peering
        requests are behind a proxy there could well be more than 1 per IP. In the current implementation, flag always restricts
        access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given.             The flags are
        not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can generally
        be classed into two categories, those which restrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and
        attempts to do runtime reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may be specified kod
          If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kissodeath KoD packet is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to
        no more than one per second. If another KoD packet occurs within one second after the last one, the packet is dropped.
        limited
          Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits specified in the discard command. A history of clients is
        kept using the monitoring capability of                  ntpd
        . Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry with the limited flag.
        lowpriotrap
          Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority.  The number of traps a server can maintain is limited the
        current limit is 3. Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being
        denied service.  This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden by later
        requests for normal priority traps.               noepeer
          Deny ephemeral peer requests, even if they come from an authenticated source. Note that the ability to use a symmetric
        key for authentication may be restricted to one or more IPs or subnets via the third field of the ntp.keys file. This
        restriction is not enabled by default, to maintain backward compatibility. Expect noepeer to become the default in
        ntp4.4
        .               nomodify
          Deny                  ntpq
         and                  ntpdc
         queries which attempt to modify the state of the server i.e., run time reconfiguration. Queries which return
        information are permitted.               noquery
          Deny                  ntpq
         and                  ntpdc
         queries. Time service is not affected.               nopeer
          Deny unauthenticated packets which would result in mobilizing a new association. This includes broadcast and symmetric
        active packets when a configured association does not exist. It also includes pool associations, so if you want to use
        servers from a pool directive and also want to use                  nopeer
         by default, youll want a restrict source ... line as well that does not include the                  nopeer
         directive.               noserve
          Deny all packets except                  ntpq
         and                  ntpdc
         queries.               notrap
          Decline to provide mode 6 control message trap service to matching hosts. The trap service is a subsystem of the
        ntpq
         control message protocol which is intended for use by remote event logging programs.               notrust
          Deny service unless the packet is cryptographically authenticated.               ntpport
          This is actually a match algorithm modifier, rather than a restriction flag. Its presence causes the restriction entry
        to be matched only if the source port in the packet is the standard NTP UDP port 123. Both                  ntpport
         and                  nonntpport
         may be specified. The                  ntpport
         is considered more specific and is sorted later in the                 list.

        The various modes are determined by the command keyword and the type of the required IP address.  Addresses are classed
        by type as s a remote server or peer IPv4 class A, B and C, b the broadcast address of a local interface, m a multicast
        address IPv4 class D, or r a reference clock address 127.127.x.x. Note
         That only those options applicable to each command are listed below. Use of options not listed may not be caught as an
        error, but may result in some weird and even destructive behavior.
        If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 RFC2553 is detected, support for the IPv6 address family is generated
        in addition to the default support of the IPv4 address family.  In a few cases, including the reslist billboard

        field. IPv6 addresses can be used almost everywhere where IPv4 addresses can be used, with the exception of reference
        clock addresses, which are always IPv4.             Note
         In contexts where a host name is expected, a 4 qualifier preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4
        namespace, while a 6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace. See IPv6 references for the equivalent
        classes for that address family.             pool  For type s addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client mode
        association with a number of remote servers. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the
        remote server can never be synchronized to the local clock. server  For type s and r addresses, this command mobilizes a
        persistent client mode association with the specified remote server or local radio clock.  In this mode the local clock
        can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local clock. This command

    description: |
        Bluetooth is a shortrange wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between devices over short
        distances. It employs UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz. It is mainly used as an alternative
        to wire connections.
    remediation: |
        Run the following commands to stop                  bluetooth.service
        , and remove the                  bluez
         package:
        # systemctl stop bluetooth.service
        # apt purge bluez
                       -OR- -IF-
         the                  bluez
         package is required as a dependency:
        Run the following commands to stop and mask                  bluetooth.service
        :
        # systemctl stop bluetooth.service
        # systemctl mask bluetooth.service
                       Note:
         A reboot may be required               Impact: Many personal electronic devices (PEDs) use Bluetooth technology. For
        example, you may be able to operate your computer with a wireless keyboard. Disabling Bluetooth will prevent these
        devices from connecting to the system.
        There may be packages that are dependent on the                    bluez
         package.  If the                    bluez
         package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the                    bluez
         package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system.                 -IF-
         a dependent package is required: stop and mask                    bluetooth.service
         leaving the                    bluez

        When              tcpsyncookies
         is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the halfopen connection queue is full, at which time, the
        SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply
        replies to the SYN with a SYNACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and
        destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK
        packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it

         The rules will still be flushed, but the ssh port will be open after enabling the firewall. Please note that once ufw

        crontab
         is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. Each user can have their
        own crontab, and though these are files in                /var/spool/cron/crontabs
        , they are not intended to be edited directly.
        If the                /etc/cron.allow
         file exists, then you must be listed one user per line therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the
        /etc/cron.allow
         file does not exist but the                /etc/cron.deny
         file does exist, then you must not be listed in the                /etc/cron.deny
         file in order to use this command.             If neither of these files exists, then depending on sitedependent
        configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this
        command.
        If both files exist then                /etc/cron.allow
         takes precedence. Which means that                /etc/cron.deny
         is not considered and your user must be listed in                /etc/cron.allow
         in order to be able to use the crontab.             Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root
        administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab.
        The files                /etc/cron.allow
         and                /etc/cron.deny
        , if they exist, must be either worldreadable, or readable by group                crontab
        . If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed.
        There is one file for each users crontab under the                /var/spool/cron/crontabs
         directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by
        the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is
        enforced by having the directory writable only by the                crontab
         group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group.             Note
        Even though a given user is not listed in                  cron.allow
        , cron jobs can still be run as that user
        The files                  /etc/cron.allow
         and                  /etc/cron.deny
        , if they exist, only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs

         allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HHMM to run a
        job at a specific time of day. If that time is already past, the next day is assumed. You may also specify midnight,
        noon, or teatime 4pm and you can have a timeofday suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You
        can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form monthname day with an optional year, or giving a
        date of the form MMDDCCYY, MM/DD/CCYY,  DD.MM.CCYY or CCYYMMDD. The specification of a date must follow the
        specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now  count timeunits, where the timeunits can be minutes,
        hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job
        tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.

         files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list
        of usernames, one on each line. Whitespace is not permitted. If the file                /etc/at.allow

        key that corresponds to a private key will be able to authenticate successfully.

        There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is recommended that
        at least one of the following options be leveraged AllowUsers


        The                    AllowUsers
         variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to                    ssh

        variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in
        from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of userhost.

        INFO
         level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response,
        it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users
        who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.           VERBOSE
         level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any SSH key used for login will be
        logged. This information is important for SSH key management, especially in legacy environments.

    section: 'Configure SSH Server'
    description: |
        Note
         To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are
        not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never
        had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before              8.2p1
         there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users.
        This bug has been resolved in              8.2p1
         and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users.
        The two options              ClientAliveInterval
         and              ClientAliveCountMax
         control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from              man 5 sshdconfig
                   ClientAliveInterval
         Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd8 will send a message
        through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages
        will not be sent to the client.               ClientAliveCountMax
         Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd8 receiving any messages back from the client.
        If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating
        the session.  It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The
        client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive
        option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on
        knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.
        The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default,
        unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax
        disables connection termination.

    section: 'User Accounts and Environment'
    description: |
        The user filecreation mode mask              umask
         is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for
        any newly created directory is 0777 rwxrwxrwx, and for any newly created file it is 0666 rwrwrw. The              umask
         modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting masking these permissions. The              umask
         is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the              umask
         are cleared in the resulting file mode.           umask
         can be set with either                octal
         or                Symbolic

         Numeric Value  Represented by either three or four digits. ie                umask 0027
         or                umask 027
        .  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting
        permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.             Symbolic
         Value  Represented by a comma separated list for User                u
        , group                g
        , and world/other                o
        .  The permissions listed are not masked by                umask
        . ie a                umask
         set by                umask urwx,grx,o
         is the                Symbolic
         equivalent of the                Octal
                              umask 027
        .  This                umask
         would set a newly created directory with file mode                drwxrx
         and a newly created file with file mode                rwr

         directive that can alter the intended file creation mode. In addition, consideration should be given to how
        FileCreateMode

        If there are any special mount points that are not visible by default from just scanning                    /
        , change the                    PARTITION
         variable to the appropriate partition and re-run the remediation.                 Impact:
        Both the audit and remediation section of this recommendation will traverse all mounted file systems that is not mounted
        with either                      noexec
         or                      nosuid
         mount options. If there are large file systems without these mount options,                      such traversal will be
        significantly detrimental to the performance of the system.
                                    Before running either the audit or remediation section, inspect the output of the following
        command to determine exactly which file systems will be traversed: # findmnt -n -l -k -it $(awk '/nodev/ { print $2 }'
        /proc/filesystems | paste -sd,) | grep -Pv "noexec|nosuid"

        To exclude a particular file system due to adverse performance impacts, update the audit and remediation sections by
        adding a sufficiently unique string to the                      grep
         statement. The above command can be used to test the modified exclusions.

    remediation: |
        World Writable Files:

         ), but always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application dependencies on a given file.

        World Writable Directories:

        Set the sticky bit on all world writable directories with the command (                        chmod a+t
        <directory_name>
         )
                                 Run the following script to: Remove other write permission from any world writable files Add

        personal files.  While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users home directories, the users
        can easily override these. Users can be defined in              /etc/passwd
         without a home directory or with a home directory that does not actually exist.
    remediation: |
        If a local interactive users' home directory is undefined and/or doesn't exist, follow local site policy and perform one
        of the following: Lock the user account Remove the user from the system
        create a directory for the user.  If undefined, edit                    /etc/passwd
         and add the absolute path to the directory to the last field of the user.                 Run the following script to:

    section: 'Local User and Group Settings'
    description: |
        While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users dot files, the users can easily override
        these. .forward
         file specifies an email address to forward the users mail to.             .rhost
         file provides the remote authentication database for the rcp, rlogin, and rsh commands and the rcmd function. These
        files bypass the standard passwordbased user authentication mechanism. They specify remote hosts and users that are
        considered trusted i.e. are allowed to access the local system without supplying a password             .netrc
         file contains data for logging into a remote host or passing authentication to an API.             .bashhistory
         file keeps track of the users last 500 commands.
    remediation: |
        Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result in unexpected outages and
        unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring policy be established to report user dot file permissions
        and determine the action to be taken in accordance with site policy. The following script will:
        remove excessive permissions on                    dot
         files within interactive users' home directories
        change ownership of                    dot
         files within interactive users' home directories to the user
        change group ownership of                    dot
         files within interactive users' home directories to the user's primary group
        list                    .forward
         and                    .rhost
