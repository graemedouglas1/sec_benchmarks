    title: '1.1.1 | L1 Ensure Enforce password history is set to 24 or more passwords'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account
        before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default
        value for standalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 passwords. To
        maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly
        changing their password.
        The recommended state for this setting is              24 or more passwords
        .           Note
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the
        Default Domain Policy
         GPO in order to be globally in effect on              domain
         user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect
        local
         user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and
        account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects
        PSOs, which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative
        Center.           Note 2
         As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum limit of 24 saved passwords. For more
        information, please visit              Enforce password history Windows 10  Windows security  Microsoft Docs

        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to                  24 or more password(s)
        :               Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password
        Policy\Enforce password history
         Impact: The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to
        change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk
        of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create
        passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make
        them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase
        administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting
        range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack
        passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password.
        However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to
        users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.
        The recommended state for this setting is              365 or fewer days, but not 0

         Impact: If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a
        configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location
        or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced
        because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

    title: '1.1.4 | L1 Ensure Minimum password length is set to 14 or more characters'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many
        different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps passphrase is a
        better term than password. In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces.
        Therefore, a phrase such as I want to drink a 5 milkshake is a valid passphrase it is a considerably stronger password
        than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated
        about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise
        environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this
        value to meet your organizations business requirements.
        The recommended state for this setting is              14 or more characters
        .           Note
         In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy LSP, Local Group
        Policy Editor LGPE and Group Policy Management Editor GPME would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters.
        However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password
        length.           Note 2
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the

        Policy\Minimum password length
         Impact: Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users
        might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords
        could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten
        passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to
        remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note:
         Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14
        characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that
        use accounts that require long passwords.

    title: '1.1.5 | L1 Ensure Password must meet complexity requirements is set to Enabled'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this
        policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements Not contain the users account name or parts of
        the users full name that exceed two consecutive characters Be at least six characters in length Contain characters from
        three of the following categories English uppercase characters A through Z English lowercase characters a through z Base
        10 digits 0 through 9 Nonalphabetic characters for example, !, , ,  A catchall category of any Unicode character that
        does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional
        character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a sevencharacter, all lowercase alphabetic
        password would have 26 to the power of 7 approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion possible combinations. At
        1,000,000 attempts per second a capability of many passwordcracking utilities, it would only take 133 minutes to crack.
        A sevencharacter alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A sevencharacter
        casesensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 62 to the power of 7 combinations. An eightcharacter
        password has 26 to the power of 8 or 2 x 1011 possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at
        1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will
        significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as ! or . Proper
        use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Enabled
        .           Note
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the

        Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements
         Impact: If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out
        accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However,
        all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has
        more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of
        arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper
        row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits
        between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password
        does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly
        enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an
        extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords
        to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard
        alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

        Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period
        until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.
        The recommended state for this setting is              15 or more minutes
        .           Note
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the
        Default Domain Policy
         GPO in order to be globally in effect on              domain
         user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect
        local
         user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and
        account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects
        PSOs, which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative
        Center.

         Impact: If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is too long, a
        DoS attack could occur. An attacker could maliciously attempt to log on to each user's account numerous times and lock
        out their accounts as described in the preceding paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter
        after setting, administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this policy setting to a
        reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after which their accounts would unlock automatically.
        Be sure that you notify users of the values used for this policy setting so that they will wait for the lockout timer to
        expire before they call the help desk about their inability to log on.

    section: 'User Rights Assignment'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system
        objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic
        link. A symbolic link is a pointer much like a shortcut or .lnk file to another file system object, which can be a file,
        folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only
        works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with
        symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
        Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For
        this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
        Administrators
         can create symbolic links.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Administrators

        system components will need it.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Administrators
        .           Note
         This user right is considered a sensitive privilege for the purposes of auditing.

         Impact:
        If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical circumstances rarely require this
        capability on production computers. If a problem arises that requires an application to be debugged on a production
        server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily and assign the                    Debug programs
         user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU.
        The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the                    Debug programs
         user right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail.
        Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not owned by the person who runs the
        tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tool                    Kill.exe

         Configuring a Member Server or standalone server as described above may adversely affect applications that create a
        local service account and place it in the Administrators group  in which case you must either convert the application to
        use a domainhosted service account, or remove              Local account and member of Administrators group

        the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. If the Audit Shut down system

        Options\Domain controller: LDAP server channel binding token requirements
         Note:
         This Group Policy path requires the installation of the March 2020 (or later) Windows security update. With that
        update, Microsoft added this setting to the built-in OS security template.                 Impact:
        All LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). The LDAP server (Domain Controller)
        rejects authentication requests from clients that do not do so. Clients must have the                      CVC-2017-8563
         security update to support this feature, and may have compatibility issues with this setting without the security
        update. This may also mean that LDAP authentication requests over SSL/TLS that previously worked may stop working until
        the security update is installed.
        When first deploying this setting, you may                      initially
         want to only set it to the alternate setting of                      When supported
         (instead of                      Always
        ) on all Domain Controllers. This alternate,                      interim
         setting enables support for LDAP client channel binding but does not                      require
         it. Then set one DC that is not currently being targeted by LDAP clients to                      Always
        , and test each of the critical LDAP clients against that DC (and remediating as necessary), before deploying
        Always
         to the rest of the DCs.
        We also recommend using the new Event ID 3039 on your Domain Controllers (added with the March 2020 security update) to
        help locate clients that do not use Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) in their LDAPS connections. This new Event ID requires
        increasing the logging level of the                      16 LDAP Interface Events
         portion of the NTDS service diagnostics to a value of                      2
         (Basic). For more information, please see                      Table 2: CBT events

        Older OSes such as Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), will first require
        patches for                      Microsoft Security Advisory 973811
        , as well as all associated fixes, in order to be compatible with domain controllers that have this setting deployed.

        If you select                      Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session

        Options\Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)
         Impact: The Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client unless that client agrees to
        perform SMB packet signing. The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP
        Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
        which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB
        signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the
        client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be
        signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small
        business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
        may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older
        applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
        computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.
        When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running
        Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that

        This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer. The Public Key Cryptography
        Based UsertoUser PKU2U protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support
        provider SSP. The SSP enables peertopeer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing
        feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.
        With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,                Spnego.dll
        . In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension
        SSP for Negotiate,                Negoexts.dll
        , which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.
        When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,                Negoexts.dll
         calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the
        policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to
        the logon peer for validation and associates the users certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

        LAN Manager LM was a family of early Microsoft client/server software predating Windows NT that allowed users to link
        personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing,
        user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the
        default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory
        will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 NTLMv2 variants, and
        is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations Join a
        domain Authenticate between Active Directory forests Authenticate to downlevel domains Authenticate to computers that do

        This subcategory reports the results of validation tests on credentials submitted for a user account logon request.
        These events occur on the computer that is authoritative for the credentials. For domain accounts, the Domain Controller
        is authoritative, whereas for local accounts, the local computer is authoritative. In domain environments, most of the
        Account Logon events occur in the Security log of the Domain Controllers that are authoritative for the domain accounts.
        However, these events can occur on other computers in the organization when local accounts are used to log on. Events
        for this subcategory include 4774 An account was mapped for logon. 4775 An account could not be mapped for logon. 4776
        The Domain Controller attempted to validate the credentials for an account. 4777 The Domain Controller failed to

        This subcategory reports changes to objects in Active Directory Domain Services AD DS. The types of changes that are
        reported are create, modify, move, and undelete operations that are performed on an object. DS Change auditing, where
        appropriate, indicates the old and new values of the changed properties of the objects that were changed. Only objects
        with SACLs cause audit events to be generated, and only when they are accessed in a manner that matches their SACL. Some
        objects and properties do not cause audit events to be generated due to settings on the object class in the schema. This
        subcategory applies only to Domain Controllers. Events for this subcategory include 5136  A directory service object was
        modified. 5137  A directory service object was created. 5138  A directory service object was undeleted. 5139  A

        include 4960 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate
        a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the
        remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability
        problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this
        problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that
        failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963 IPsec
        dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing
        its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965 IPsec received a
        packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index SPI. This is usually caused by malfunctioning
        hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are
        the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec
        implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478 IPsec Services has
        started successfully. 5479 IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the
        computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5480 IPsec Services
        failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some
        of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor
        snapin to diagnose the problem. 5483 IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be
        started. 5484 IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services
        can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485 IPsec
        Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plugandplay event for network interfaces. This poses a potential
        security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

        This value controls how often TCP attempts to verify that an idle connection is still intact by sending a keepalive
        packet. If the remote computer is still reachable, it acknowledges the keepalive packet.

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able
        to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able
        to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

         By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established
        the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the
        Server authentication certificate template
         setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate
        template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a
        valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the server for it to work.
