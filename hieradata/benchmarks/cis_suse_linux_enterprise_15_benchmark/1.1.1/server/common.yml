    title: '1.1.1.1 | Ensure mounting of squashfs filesystems is disabled'
    section: 'Disable unused filesystems'
    description: |
        The                squashfs
         filesystem type is a compressed readonly Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems similar to
        cramfs
         . A                squashfs
         image can be used without having to first decompress the image.
    remediation: |
        Edit or create a file in the                    /etc/modprobe.d/
         directory ending in .conf
        Example:                    vi /etc/modprobe.d/squashfs.conf
                         and add the following line: install squashfs /bin/true

        Run the following command to unload the                    squashfs
         module:                 # modprobe -r squashfs
         Impact: Disabling squashfs will prevent the use of snap.  Snap is a package manager for Linux for installing Snap
        packages. "Snap" application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions.
        This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted
        packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to
        their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from
        any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment. When snaps are deployed on versions of Linux, the
        Ubuntu app store is used as default back-end, but other stores can be enabled as well.

        The                udf
         filesystem type is the universal disk format used to implement ISO/IEC 13346 and ECMA167 specifications. This is an
        open vendor filesystem type for data storage on a broad range of media. This filesystem type is necessary to support
        writing DVDs and newer optical disc formats.

    section: 'Disable unused filesystems'
    description: |
        The                FAT
         filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB drives or flash modules. It comes in
        three types                FAT12
         ,                FAT16
         , and                FAT32
          all of which are supported by the                vfat
          kernel module.
    remediation: |
        Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in                    .conf
         and add the following lines:
        Example:                      vim /etc/modprobe.d/fat.conf

         modules:
        # modprobe -r msdos
        # modprobe -r vfat
        # modprobe -r fat
                         Impact:
        The                      FAT
         filesystem format is used by UEFI systems for the EFI boot partition.  Disabling the vfat module can prevent boot on
        UEFI systems.                   FAT
         filesystems are often used on portable USB sticks and other flash media which are commonly used to transfer files
        between workstations, removing VFAT support may prevent the ability to transfer files in this way.

          Example:
          tmpfs	/tmp	tmpfs     defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime  0 0

        Run the following command to remount                    /tmp

         Impact:
        Since the                    /tmp
         directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate
        partition.
        Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default
        installation a disk-based                    /tmp
         will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single                    /
         partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                    /tmp
         as with                    tmpfs
         will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.

        access has sufficient physical controls, requiring manual mounting may not increase security.

                         Does not bother with the full NTP complexity Only on querys time from one remote server, synchronizing
        the local clock to it
                       runs with minimal privileges
        saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired
                         Uses this to correct the system clock early at bootup to make sure that time monotonically progresses
        on these systems, even if it is not always correct
                       Requires a new system user and group systemdtimesync to be created on installation of systemd Hooked up
        with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available Notes The systemdtimesyncd service specifically
        implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for
        smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemdtimesyncd. This recommendation only applies if

        The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start,
        registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then
        contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind service redirects the client to the
        proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens
        on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc. to their
        corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with
        portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening.

        v0.6.0. In Fedora 19 Linux derivatives,  firewalld utilizes iptables as its backend by default. firewalld may be
        configured as the frontend to nftables.  If this case, nftables should be stopped and masked instead of removed.

    section: 'Configure firewalld'
    description: |
        A firewall zone defines the trust level for a connection, interface or source address binding. This is a one to many
        relation, which means that a connection, interface or source can only be part of one zone, but a zone can be used for
        many network connections, interfaces and sources. The default zone is the zone that is used for everything that is not
        explicitly bound/assigned to another zone. If no zone assigned to a connection, interface or source, only the default
        zone is used. The default zone is not always listed as being used for an interface or source as it will be used for it
        either way. This depends on the manager of the interfaces. Connections handled by NetworkManager are listed as
        NetworkManager requests to add the zone binding for the interface used by the connection. Also interfaces under control
        of the network service are listed also because the service requests it. Notes A firewalld zone configuration file
        contains the information for a zone. These are the zone description, services, ports, protocols, icmpblocks, masquerade,
        forwardports and rich language rules in an XML file format.
        The file name has to be                        zonename.xml
         where length of                        zonename

        firewall zones define the trust level of network connections or interfaces. Note The firewall in the Linux kernel is not
        able to handle network connections with the name shown by NetworkManager, it can only handle the network interfaces used
        by the connection. Because of this NetworkManager tells firewalld to assign the network interface that is used for this
        connection to the zone defined in the configuration of that connection. This assignment happens before the interface is
        used. The configuration of the connection can either be the NetworkManager configuration or also an ifcfg. For example
        If the zone is not set in the configuration file, the interfaces will be assigned to the default zone defined in the
        firewalld configuration. If a connection has more than one interface, all of them will be supplied to firewalld. Also
        changes in the names of interfaces will be handled by NetworkManager and supplied to firewalld.

        Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server.  Utilities exist to accept
        remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service provides a consistent means of log collection and
        export. Notes This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a
        remote log host has been implemented.
        The main configuration file                    /etc/systemd/journald.conf
         is read before any of the custom .conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration
        parameters
        As noted in the journald man pages journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here,
        or through a facility like                    systemdjournald.service
        .  There are tradeoffs involved in each implementation, where                    ForwardToSyslog
         will immediately capture all events and forward to an external log server, if properly configured, but may not capture
        all bootup activities.  Mechanisms such as                    systemdjournald.service
        , on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the
        potential for log manipulation prior to export.  Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.

        The two options              ClientAliveInterval
         and              ClientAliveCountMax
         control the timeout of ssh sessions.           ClientAliveInterval
         sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message
        through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages
        will not be sent to the client.             ClientAliveCountMax
         sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If
        this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the
        session. The default value is                3
        .
                       The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel

         is set to 15 seconds and the              ClientAliveCountMax

        These settings are commonly configured with the              pamfaillock.so
         module.  Some environments may continue using the              pamtally2.so
         module, where this older method may simplify automation in mixed environments.
        Set the lockout number in              deny
         to the policy in effect at your site.           unlocktimen
         is the number of seconds the account remains locked after the number of attempts configured in              denyn
         has been met.           Notes Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here. If

                       Use of the audit keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during authentication.  This risk
        should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your organization. You may also lock out root, this should be
        considered carefully due to the ability to have this setting lock all access to the system As an option on the same line

    description: |
        The user filecreation mode mask              umask
         is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for
        any newly created directory is 0777 rwxrwxrwx, and for any newly created file it is 0666 rwrwrw. The              umask
         modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting masking these permissions. The              umask
         is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the              umask
         are cleared in the resulting file mode.
        The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions by

        Issuing the                    chmod
         command
        Choosing a different default                    umask

        .  This                umask
         would set a newly created directory with file mode                drwxrx
         and a newly created file with file mode                rwr
        .             umask

        The RPM package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the               V
         option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The              V
          option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the
        package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option
        Code   Meaning
        S      File size differs.
        M      File mode differs includes permissions and file type.

        T      The file time mtime differs.

        The              rpm qf
         command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following commands
        determines which package the              /etc/ssh/sshdconfig
         file belongs to
         rpm qf /etc/ssh/sshdconfig

        openssh7.9p16.14.1.x8664

        To verify the settings for the package that controls the              /etc/ssh/sshdconfig
         file, run the following
         rpm V openssh7.9p16.14.1.x8664

        Note You can feed the output of the                rpm qf

        S.5....T.  c /etc/ssh/sshdconfig
                   Notes Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is recommended to
        verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time consuming task and results may depend on site
        policy therefore it is not a scorable benchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security
        measures. Some of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by this recommendation. The

        Although the              groupadd
         program will not let you create a duplicate group name, it is possible for an administrator to manually edit the
        /etc/group
         file and change the group name.
    remediation: |
        Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique names for the user groups. File group ownerships will
        automatically reflect the change as long as the groups have unique GIDs.

        The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should
        be assigned to the shadow group.
    remediation: |
        Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with shadow as their primary group.
