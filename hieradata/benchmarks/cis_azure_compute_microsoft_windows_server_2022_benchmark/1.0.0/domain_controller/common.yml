    title: '1.1.1 | L1 Ensure Enforce password history is set to 24 or more passwords'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account
        before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default
        value for standalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 passwords. To
        maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly
        changing their password.
        The recommended state for this setting is              24 or more passwords
        .           Note
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the
        Default Domain Policy
         GPO in order to be globally in effect on              domain
         user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect
        local
         user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and
        account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects
        PSOs, which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative
        Center.           Note 2
         As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum limit of 24 saved passwords. For more
        information, please visit              Enforce password history Windows 10  Windows security  Microsoft Docs

        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to                  24 or more password(s)
        :               Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password
        Policy\Enforce password history
         Impact: The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to
        change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk
        of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create
        passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make
        them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase
        administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting
        range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack
        passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password.
        However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to
        users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.
        The recommended state for this setting is              365 or fewer days, but not 0

        Policy\Maximum password age
         Impact: If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a
        configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location
        or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced
        because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

    title: '1.1.4 | L1 Ensure Minimum password length is set to 14 or more characters'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many
        different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps passphrase is a
        better term than password. In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces.
        Therefore, a phrase such as I want to drink a 5 milkshake is a valid passphrase it is a considerably stronger password
        than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated
        about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise
        environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this
        value to meet your organizations business requirements.
        The recommended state for this setting is              14 or more characters
        .           Note
         In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy LSP, Local Group
        Policy Editor LGPE and Group Policy Management Editor GPME would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters.
        However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password
        length.           Note 2
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the

        :               Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password
        Policy\Minimum password length
         Impact: Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users
        might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords
        could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten
        passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to
        remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note:
         Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14
        characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that
        use accounts that require long passwords.

    title: '1.1.5 | L1 Ensure Password must meet complexity requirements is set to Enabled'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this
        policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements Not contain the users account name or parts of
        the users full name that exceed two consecutive characters Be at least six characters in length Contain characters from
        three of the following categories English uppercase characters A through Z English lowercase characters a through z Base
        10 digits 0 through 9 Nonalphabetic characters for example, !, , ,  A catchall category of any Unicode character that
        does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional
        character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a sevencharacter, all lowercase alphabetic
        password would have 267 approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second a
        capability of many passwordcracking utilities, it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A sevencharacter alphabetic
        password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A sevencharacter casesensitive alphanumeric password without
        punctuation has 627 combinations. An eightcharacter password has 268 or 2 x 1011 possible combinations. Although this
        might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible
        passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special
        keyboard characters such as ! or . Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force
        attack.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Enabled
        .           Note
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the

        Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements
         Impact: If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out
        accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However,
        all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has
        more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of
        arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper
        row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits
        between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password
        does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly
        enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an
        extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords
        to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard
        alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

        computer account is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However,
        some organizations may want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can
        consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers to the domain, tracking and
        management efforts would be hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of
        their ability to create additional unauthorized domain computers.

        This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system
        objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic
        link. A symbolic link is a pointer much like a shortcut or .lnk file to another file system object, which can be a file,
        folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only
        works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with
        symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
        Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For
        this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
        Administrators

        All LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). The LDAP server (Domain Controller)
        rejects authentication requests from clients that do not do so. Clients must have the                      CVC-2017-8563
         security update to support this feature, and may have compatibility issues with this setting without the security
        update. This may also mean that LDAP authentication requests over SSL/TLS that previously worked may stop working until
        the security update is installed.
        When first deploying this setting, you may                      initially
         want to only set it to the alternate setting of                      When supported

        ) on all Domain Controllers. This alternate,                      interim
         setting enables support for LDAP client channel binding but does not                      require
         it. Then set one DC that is not currently being targeted by LDAP clients to                      Always
        , and test each of the critical LDAP clients against that DC (and remediating as necessary), before deploying
        Always
         to the rest of the DCs.
        We also recommend using the new Event ID 3039 on your Domain Controllers (added with the March 2020 security update) to
        help locate clients that do not use Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) in their LDAPS connections. This new Event ID requires
        increasing the logging level of the                      16 LDAP Interface Events
         portion of the NTDS service diagnostics to a value of                      2

         Impact: The Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client unless that client agrees to
        perform SMB packet signing. The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP
        Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
        which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB
        signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the
        client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be
        signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small
        business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
        may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older
        applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
        computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.
        When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running
        Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that

        This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer. The Public Key Cryptography
        Based UsertoUser PKU2U protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support
        provider SSP. The SSP enables peertopeer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing
        feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.
        With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,                Spnego.dll
        . In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension
        SSP for Negotiate,                Negoexts.dll
        , which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.
        When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,                Negoexts.dll
         calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the
        policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to
        the logon peer for validation and associates the users certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

        are The Bnode broadcast method only uses broadcasts. The Pnode pointtopoint method only uses name queries to a name
        server WINS. The Mnode mixed method broadcasts first, then queries a name server WINS if broadcast failed. The Hnode
        hybrid method queries a name server WINS first, then broadcasts if the query failed.

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able
        to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able
        to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.
