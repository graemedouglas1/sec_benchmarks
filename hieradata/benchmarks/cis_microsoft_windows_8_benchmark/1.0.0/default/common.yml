    title: '1.1.1.1 | Set Account lockout threshold to 5 invalid logon attempts'
    section: 'Account Policies'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the number of failed logon
                          attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users can lock themselves out of an
                          account by mistyping their password or by remembering it incorrectly, or by
                          changing their password on one computer while logged on to another computer. The
                          computer with the incorrect password will continuously try to authenticate the
                          user, and because the password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock
                          occurs. To avoid accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout
                          threshold to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid
                          logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature. Because it is possible
                          for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of service DoS by
                          triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your organization should
                          determine whether to use this policy setting based on identified threats and the
                          risks you want to mitigate. There are two options to consider for this policy
                          setting.  Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that
                          accounts will not be locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that
                          attempts to lock out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk
                          calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their accounts
                          accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a brute force attack.
                          The following defenses should also be considered  A password policy that forces
                          all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more characters.  A robust
                          auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account
                          lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should
                          monitor for security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies
                          that there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt. The second
                          option is  Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to a value that
                          provides users with the ability to mistype their password several times, but locks
                          out the account if a brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will
                          prevent accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not
                          prevent a DoS attack. The recommended state for this setting is  5 invalid logon
                             attempts .
    remediation: |
        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path
                                to  5 invalid logon attempt(s) .  Computer Configuration\Windows

                                   Policy\Account lockout threshold
                              Impact: If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable
                                until it is reset by an administrator or until the account lockout duration
                                expires. This setting will likely generate a number of additional help desk
                                calls. In fact, locked accounts cause the greatest number of calls to the
                                help desk in many organizations. If you enforce this setting an attacker
                                could cause a denial of service condition by deliberately generating failed
                                logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure the Account
                                Lockout Duration to a relatively low value such as 15 minutes. If you
                                configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an
                                attacker's attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack
                                might go undetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place.

    description: |
        This policy setting determines the length
                             of time that must pass before a locked account is unlocked and a user can try
                             to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number of minutes a
                             locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy
                             setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an
                             administrator manually unlocks them. Although it might seem like a good
                             idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a high value, such a
                             configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk
                             receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the
                             length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to
                             call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to
                             their computer. The recommended state for this setting is  15 or more minutes .

    title: '1.1.1.3 | Set Reset account lockout counter after to 15 minutes'
    section: 'Account Policies'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the length of time before
                          the Account lockout threshold resets to zero. The default value for this policy
                          setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset
                          time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration
                          setting. If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the
                          value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a
                          DoS attack. An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon
                          attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If
                          no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task
                          for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this
                          policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the
                          accounts are unlocked automatically. The recommended state for this setting is
                              15

                              Impact: If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to
                                an interval that is too long, a DoS attack could occur. An attacker could
                                maliciously attempt to log on to each user's account numerous times and lock
                                out their accounts as described in the preceding paragraphs. If you do not
                                configure the Reset account lockout counter after setting, administrators
                                would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this policy
                                setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period,
                                after which their accounts would unlock automatically. Be sure that you
                                notify users of the values used for this policy setting so that they will
                                wait for the lockout timer to expire before they call the help desk about
                                their inability to log on.

    section: 'Account Policies'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the least
                             number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many
                             different theories about how to determine the best password length for an
                             organization, but perhaps pass phrase is a better term than password. In
                             Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can include
                             spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as I want to drink a 5 milkshake is a valid
                             pass phrase it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character
                             string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must
                             be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially
                             with regard to password length. The recommended state for this setting is
                                 14 or more characters .

                                   password length Impact: Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the
                                   security of an organization, because users might leave the information in
                                   an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required,
                                   mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume
                                   of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten
                                   passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your
                                   users about pass phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to
                                   the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note:  Older versions
        of Windows such as Windows 98 and
                                   Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14
                                   characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable
                                   to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that require
                                   long passwords.

                             of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account
                             before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be

        new
                                   password every time they are required to change their old one. If users
                                   are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an
                                   increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they
                                   do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that
                                   change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to
                                   facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an

                                   increase administrative overhead, because users who forget their
                                   passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

        This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure
                          that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this policy is
                          enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements  Not contain the
                          users account name or parts of the users full name that exceed two consecutive
                          characters  Be at least six characters in length  Contain characters from three
                          of the following four categories  English uppercase characters A through Z
                          English lowercase characters a through z  Base 10 digits 0 through 9
                          Nonalphabetic characters for example, !, , ,   A catchall category of any
                          Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This
                          fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional character in a password
                          increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a sevencharacter, all
                          lowercase alphabetic password would have 267 approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion
                          possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second a capability of many
                          passwordcracking utilities, it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A
                          sevencharacter alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A
                          sevencharacter casesensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627
                          combinations. An eightcharacter password has 268 or 2 x 1011 possible
                          combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts
                          per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember,
                          these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and
                          other special keyboard characters such as ! or . Proper use of the password
                          settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. The recommended

                                help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not
                                be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However,
                                all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with
                                minimal difficulty. If your organization has more stringent security
                                requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that
                                allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example,
                                a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters.
                                (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key
                                and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might
                                also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does
                                not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key
                                character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password.
                                However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users
                                and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could
                                consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters
                                in the 01280159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent
                                standard alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to
                                the password.)

    description: |
        This policy setting determines whether the operating
                          system stores passwords in a way that uses reversible encryption, which provides
                          support for application protocols that require knowledge of the users password
                          for authentication purposes. Passwords that are stored with reversible encryption
                          are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the passwords. The recommended
                          state for this setting is  Disabled .

                                   password age Impact: If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to
                                   change the password when the user first logs on, the administrator must

    description: |
        This policy setting defines how long a
                             user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy
                             setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will
                             never expire. The default value for this policy setting is 42 days. Because
                             attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the
                             less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower
                             this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help
                             desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which
                             password is current. The recommended state for this setting is  60 or fewer days .

                                   password age Impact: If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to
                                   change their passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce
                                   security in the organization, because users might write their passwords
                                   in an insecure location or lose them. If the value for this policy
                                   setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is
                                   reduced because it allows potential attackers more time in which to
                                   discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

                          Only objects with SACLs cause audit events to be generated, and only when they are
                          accessed in a manner that matches their SACL. These events are similar to the
                          directory service access events in previous versions of Windows Server. This
                          subcategory applies only to domain controllers. Events for this subcategory
                          include 4662  An operation was performed on an object. Refer to the Microsoft

        This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet
                          Protocol security IPsec driver. Events for this subcategory include 4960 IPsec
                          dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem
                          persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in
                          transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer
                          are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate
                          interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961 IPsec dropped an
                          inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could
                          indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962 IPsec dropped an inbound
                          packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence
                          number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963 IPsec dropped an inbound clear text
                          packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer
                          changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a
                          spoofing attack attempt. 4965 IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with
                          an incorrect Security Parameter Index SPI. This is usually caused by
                          malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist,
                          verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those
                          received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems
                          with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded,
                          then these events can be ignored. 5478 IPsec Services has started successfully.
                          5479 IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec
                          Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the
                          computer to potential security risks. 5480 IPsec Services failed to get the
                          complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential
                          security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection
                          provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snapin to
                          diagnose the problem. 5483 IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec
                          Services could not be started. 5484 IPsec Services has experienced a critical
                          failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the

                          security risks. 5485 IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a
                          plugandplay event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk
                          because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the
                          applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snapin to diagnose the
                          problem. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledgebase article Description of security

        This subcategory reports the events that occur in response
                          to credentials submitted for a user account logon request that do not relate to
                          credential validation or Kerberos tickets. These events occur on the computer that

    title: '1.1.2.19 | Set Audit Policy Object Access Registry to No Auditing'
    section: 'Advanced Audit Policy Configuration'
    description: |
        This subcategory reports when registry objects are
                          accessed. Only registry objects with SACLs cause audit events to be generated, and
                          only when they are accessed in a manner matching their SACL. By itself, this
                          policy setting will not cause auditing of any events. It determines whether to
                          audit the event of a user who accesses a registry object that has a specified
                          system access control list SACL, effectively enabling auditing to take place. A
                          SACL is comprised of access control entries ACEs. Each ACE contains three pieces
                          of information  The security principal user, computer, or group to be audited.
                           The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask.  A flag to
                          indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful access events, or both.
                          If you configure the Audit object access setting to Success, an audit entry is
                          generated each time that a user successfully accesses an object with a specified
                          SACL. If you configure this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated
                          each time that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                          SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when they
                          configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and Append Data
                          auditing setting on executable files to track when they are changed or replaced,
                          because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses typically target executable
                          files. Similarly, you might want to track when sensitive documents are accessed or
                          changed. Events for this subcategory include 4657  A registry value was
                          modified. 5039 A registry key was virtualized. Refer to the Microsoft

                          A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful access
                          events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting to Success, an
                          audit entry is generated each time that a user successfully accesses an object
                          with a specified SACL. If you configure this policy setting to Failure, an audit
                          entry is generated each time that a user fails in an attempt to access an object
                          with a specified SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want
                          enabled when they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write
                          and Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                          changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses typically
                          target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track when sensitive
                          documents are accessed or changed. Events for this subcategory include 5140 A

    description: |
        This subcategory reports when file system objects are
                          accessed. Only file system objects with SACLs cause audit events to be generated,
                          and only when they are accessed in a manner matching their SACL. By itself, this
                          policy setting will not cause auditing of any events. It determines whether to
                          audit the event of a user who accesses a file system object that has a specified
                          system access control list SACL, effectively enabling auditing to take place. A
                          SACL is comprised of access control entries ACEs. Each ACE contains three pieces
                          of information  The security principal user, computer, or group to be audited.

                          indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful access events, or both.
                          If you configure the Audit object access setting to Success, an audit entry is
                          generated each time that a user successfully accesses an object with a specified
                          SACL. If you configure this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated
                          each time that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                          SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when they
                          configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and Append Data
                          auditing setting on executable files to track when they are changed or replaced,
                          because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses typically target executable
                          files. Similarly, you might want to track when sensitive documents are accessed or

                                      that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is

                                increase this interval significantly or set it to 0 so that the computers no
                                longer change their passwords, an attacker would have more time to undertake
                                a brute force attack against one of the computer accounts. The recommended

                                      defined. Any organization should weigh the choice between the two
                                      based on their identified threats and the risks that they want to
                                      mitigate. The two countermeasure options are: Configure the Machine Lockout Threshold
        setting to 0. This
                                         configuration ensures that accounts will not be locked out, and
                                         also helps reduce help desk calls because users cannot accidentally
                                         lock themselves out of their accounts. Because it will not prevent
                                         a brute force attack, this configuration should only be chosen if
                                         both of the following criteria are explicitly met: The password policy requires all
        users to have complex passwords
                                         of 8 or more characters. A robust audit mechanism is in place to alert administrators
        when
                                         a series of failed logons occur in the environment. Configure the Machine Lockout
        Threshold setting to a sufficiently
                                         high value to provide users with the ability to accidentally
                                         mistype their password several times before the machine is locked,
                                         but ensure that a brute force password attack will still lock the
                                         account. A good recommendation for such a configuration is 50
                                         invalid logon attempts, which will prevent accidental account
                                         lockouts and reduce the number of help desk calls. This option is
                                         recommended if your organization does not have complex password
                                         requirements and an audit policy that alerts administrators to a
                                         series of failed logon attempts.

        have to use
                                      smart cards to log onto the local computer, which means that the
                                      organization will need a reliable public key infrastructure (PKI) as
                                      well as smart cards and smart card readers for these users. These
                                      requirements are significant challenges, because expertise and
                                      resources are required to plan for and deploy these technologies.
                                      However, Windows Server 2003 includes Certificate Services, a highly
                                      advanced service for implementing and managing certificates. When
                                      Certificate Services is combined with Windows XP or Windows Vista,
                                      features such as automatic user and computer enrollment and renewal
                                      become available. For more information about deploying Smart Cards

                                      provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                                      SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.
                                       Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                                      because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings

                                      operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                                      completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                                      session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled

                                administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is
                                the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is

        Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2
                                introduce an extension to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll.
                                In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decides whether to use Kerberos
                                or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts, which
                                is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs
                                including PKU2U. You can also develop or add other SSPs. When computers
                                are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,
                                Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The
                                PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the
                                peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within
                                the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the
                                users certificate to a security token and the logon process
                                completes. This policy will be turned off by default on domain joined
                                machines. This would disallow the online identities to be able to
                                authenticate to the domain joined machine in Windows 7. The recommended
                                state for this setting is  Disabled .

                                      enter the password for that certificate every time they send a signed
                                      e-mail message. For some organizations the overhead that is involved
                                      using this configuration may be too high.

                                      servers due to the significant impact on manageability. For example,
                                      if this setting is configured to "User is prompted when the key is
                                      first used" you may not be able to configure Remote Desktop Services

                                setting increases security, most public Web sites that are secured with TLS
                                or SSL do not support these algorithms. Client computers that have this

    description: |
        This policy setting determines which users can create
                          symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files
                          and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object
                          called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer much like a shortcut or .lnk
                          file to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or
                          another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is
                          that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and
                          applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the
                          concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
                          Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications
                          that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating
                          symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
                          Administrators can create symbolic links. When configuring a user right in the SCM
                          enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located
                          in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. The recommended

                          provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components.
                          Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need to be assigned
                          this user right however, developers who are debugging new system components will
                          need it. Note Microsoft released several security updates in October 2003 that
                          used a version of Update.exe that required the administrator to have the Debug
                          programs user right. Administrators who did not have this user right were unable
                          to install these security updates until they reconfigured their user rights. This
                          is not typical behavior for operating system updates. For more information, see
                          Knowledge Base article 830846 Windows Product Updates may stop responding or may
                          use most or all the CPU resources. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter
                          a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in
                          Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. The recommended state
                          for this setting is  Administrators .

                              Impact: If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs.
                                However, typical circumstances rarely require this capability on production
                                computers. If a problem arises that requires an application to be debugged
                                on a production server, you can move the server to a different OU
                                temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a separate Group
                                Policy for that OU. The service account that is used for the cluster service
                                needs the Debug programs privilege; if it does not have it, Windows
                                Clustering will fail. For additional information about how to configure
                                Windows Clustering in conjunction with computer hardening, see article
                                891597, How to apply more restrictive security settings on a Windows Server

                                (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100746). Tools that are used to
                                manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not owned by
                                the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource
                                Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate
                                processes that they did not start. Also, some older versions of Update.exe
                                (which is used to install Windows product updates) require the account that
                                applies the update to have this user right. If you install one of the
                                patches that uses this version of Update.exe, the computer could become
                                unresponsive. For more information, see article 830846, Windows Product

    description: |
        This policy setting allows a user to adjust the maximum
                          amount of memory that is available to a process. The ability to adjust memory
                          quotas is useful for system tuning, but it can be abused. In the wrong hands, it
                          could be used to launch a denial of service DoS attack. When configuring a user
                          right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either
                          local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. The

                              Impact: Organizations that have not restricted users to roles with limited
                                privileges will find it difficult to impose this countermeasure. Also, if
                                you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you may need
                                to assign the Adjust memory quotas for a process user right to additional
                                accounts that are required by those components. IIS requires that this
                                privilege be explicitly assigned to the IWAM_<ComputerName>, Network
                                Service, and Service accounts. Otherwise, this countermeasure should have no

                                account, it can be assigned to a local computer account instead of a domain
                                account.

        This policy setting determines which accounts will not be
                          able to log on to the computer as a batch job. A batch job is not a batch .bat
                          file, but rather a batchqueue facility. Accounts that use the Task Scheduler to
                          schedule jobs need this user right. The Deny log on as a batch job user right
                          overrides the Log on as a batch job user right, which could be used to allow

                              Impact: If you assign the Deny log on as a batch job user right to other accounts,
                                you could deny users who are assigned to specific administrative roles the
                                ability to perform their required job activities. You should confirm that
                                delegated tasks will not be affected adversely. For example, if you assign
                                this user right to the IWAM_<ComputerName> account, the MSM Management
                                Point will fail. On a newly installed computer that runs Windows Server 2003
                                this account does not belong to the Guests group, but on a computer that was
                                upgraded from Windows 2000 this account is a member of the Guests group.
                                Therefore, it is important that you understand which accounts belong to any
                                groups that you assign the Deny log on as a batch job user right.

                             cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an
                             outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                             Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work. Ensure that
                             these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles before
                             deploying. The recommended state for this setting is  Allow

    section: 'Public Profile'
    description: |
        This setting determines the behavior for outbound
                             connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. The default behavior
                             is to allow connections unless there are firewall rules that block the
                             connection. Important If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy
                             the firewall policy by using a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings
                             cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an
                             outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                             Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work. Ensure that
                             these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles before
                             deploying. The recommended state for this setting is  Allow

                          a new automatic connection to the same Windows domain is also blocked. Additional

        This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime
                          handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers. This policy setting
                          impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy setting should
                          be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including
                          group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can
                          require manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should
                          never be applied to a domain controller. If you disable this policy setting, the
                          RPC server runtime uses the value of Authenticated on Windows Client, and the
                          value of None on Windows Server versions that support this policy setting. If
                          you do not configure this policy setting, it remains disabled. The RPC server

                          on a machine. A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a
                          named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC
                          Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated
                          clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for

                                   manage BitLockerx2019s use of hardwarebased encryption on fixed data
                                   drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with
                                   hardwarebased encryption. Using hardwarebased encryption can improve
                                   performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing
                                   of data to the drive.
                                    If you enable this policy setting, you can specify additional
                                   options that control whether BitLocker softwarebased encryption is used
                                   instead of hardwarebased encryption on computers that do not support
                                   hardwarebased encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
                                   algorithms and cipher suites used with hardwarebased encryption.
                                    If you disable this policy setting, BitLocker cannot use
                                   hardwarebased encryption with operating system drives and BitLocker
                                   softwarebased encryption will be used by default when the drive is encrypted.
                                    If you do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use
                                   hardwarebased encryption with the encryption algorithm set for the
                                   drive. If hardwarebased encryption is not available BitLocker
                                   softwarebased encryption will be used instead.
                                    Note The x201CChoose drive encryption method and cipher
                                   strengthx201D policy setting does not apply to hardwarebased
                                   encryption. The encryption algorithm used by hardwarebased encryption is
                                   set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses the
                                   algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The
                                   x201CRestrict encryption algorithms and cipher suites allowed for
                                   hardwarebased encryptionx201D option enables you to restrict the
                                   encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with hardware encryption. If
                                   the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable
                                   the use of hardwarebased encryption. Encryption algorithms are
                                   specified by object identifiers OID. For example  AES 128 in CBC
                                   mode OID 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2  AES 256 in CBC mode OID

                                   drives. If you choose to permit the use of a password, you can require
                                   that a password be used, enforce complexity requirements on the password,
                                   and configure a minimum length for the password. For the complexity

                                    Note These settings are enforced when turning on BitLocker, not
                                   when unlocking a volume. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any
                                   of the protectors available on the drive.
                                    If you enable this policy setting, users can configure a password
                                   that meets the requirements you define. To require the use of a password,
                                   select Require password for fixed data drive. To enforce complexity
                                   requirements on the password, select Require complexity.
                                    When set to Require complexity a connection to a domain controller
                                   is necessary when BitLocker is enabled to validate the complexity the

                                   password will still be accepted regardless of actual password complexity
                                   and the drive will be encrypted using that password as a protector. When

                                   be done.
                                    Passwords must be at least 8 characters. To configure a greater
                                   minimum length for the password, enter the desired number of characters
                                   in the Minimum password length box.
                                    If you disable this policy setting, the user is not allowed to use a password.

        This policy setting allows you to
                                   control how BitLockerprotected fixed data drives are recovered in the
                                   absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when
                                   you turn on BitLocker.
                                    The Allow data recovery agent check box is used to specify whether
                                   a data recovery agent can be used with BitLockerprotected fixed data
                                   drives. Before a data recovery agent can be used it must be added from
                                   the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management
                                   Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive
                                   Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information
                                   about adding data recovery agents.
                                    In Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information select
                                   whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a
                                   48digit recovery password or a 256bit recovery key.
                                    Select Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard to
                                   prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker
                                   on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which
                                   recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker
                                   recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.
                                    In Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Doman
                                   Services choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS
                                   for fixed data drives. If you select Backup recovery password and key
                                   package, both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored
                                   in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive
                                   that has been physically corrupted. If you select Backup recovery
                                   password only, only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.
                                    Select the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is
                                   stored in AD DS for fixed data drives check box if you want to prevent
                                   users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the
                                   domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.
                                    Note If the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is
                                   stored in AD DS for fixed data drives check box is selected, a recovery
                                   password is automatically generated.
                                    If you enable this policy setting, you can control the methods
                                   available to users to recover data from BitLockerprotected fixed data drives.
                                    If this policy setting is not configured or disabled, the default
                                   recovery options are supported for BitLocker recovery. By default a DRA
                                   is allowed, the recovery options can be specified by the user including
                                   the recovery password and recovery key, and recovery information is not
                                   backed up to AD DS. The recommended state for this setting is  Allow 48digit recovery
        password .

                                   drives, you can provision a password, enforce complexity requirements on
                                   the password, and configure a minimum length for the password. For the

                                   and the drive will be encrypted using that password as a protector. When

                                   be done.
                                    Passwords must be at least 8 characters. To configure a greater
                                   minimum length for the password, enter the desired number of characters
                                   in the Minimum password length box.

                                   stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a
                                   drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select Backup recovery
                                   password only, only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.
                                    Select the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is

        This policy setting allows you to

                                   system drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with
                                   hardwarebased encryption. Using hardwarebased encryption can improve
                                   performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing
                                   of data to the drive.
                                    If you enable this policy setting, you can specify additional
                                   options that control whether BitLocker softwarebased encryption is used
                                   instead of hardwarebased encryption on computers that do not support
                                   hardwarebased encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
                                   algorithms and cipher suites used with hardwarebased encryption.
                                    If you disable this policy setting, BitLocker cannot use
                                   hardwarebased encryption with operating system drives and BitLocker
                                   softwarebased encryption will be used by default when the drive is encrypted.
                                    If you do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use
                                   hardwarebased encryption with the encryption algorithm set for the
                                   drive. If hardwarebased encryption is not available BitLocker
                                   softwarebased encryption will be used instead.

                                   strengthx201D policy setting does not apply to hardwarebased
                                   encryption. The encryption algorithm used by hardwarebased encryption is
                                   set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses the
                                   algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The
                                   x201CRestrict encryption algorithms and cipher suites allowed for
                                   hardwarebased encryptionx201D option enables you to restrict the
                                   encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with hardware encryption. If
                                   the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable
                                   the use of hardwarebased encryption. Encryption algorithms are
                                   specified by object identifiers OID. For example  AES 128 in CBC

                                   is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
                                    The Allow certificatebased data recovery agent check box is used
                                   to specify whether a data recovery agent can be used with
                                   BitLockerprotected operating system drives. Before a data recovery agent
                                   can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either
                                   the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor.
                                   Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft
                                   TechNet for more information about adding data recovery agents.
                                    In Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information select

                                   recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

                                   key package, both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are
                                   stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a
                                   drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select Backup recovery
                                   password only, only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.
                                    Select the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is

                                   key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is
                                   accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use

        This policy setting allows you to
                                   configure the encryption type used by BitLocker Drive Encryption. This
                                   policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. Changing the
                                   encryption type has no effect if the drive is already encrypted or if
                                   encryption is in progress. Choose full encryption to require that the
                                   entire drive be encrypted when BitLocker is turned on. Choose used space
                                   only encryption to require that only the portion of the drive used to
                                   store data is encrypted when BitLocker is turned on.
                                    If you enable this policy setting the encryption type that BitLocker
                                   will use to encrypt drives is defined by this policy and the encryption
                                   type option will not be presented in the BitLocker setup wizard.
                                    If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the
                                   BitLocker setup wizard will ask the user to select the encryption type
                                   before turning on BitLocker. Configure this setting in a manner that is
                                   consistent with security and operational requirements of your
                                   organization.

                                   minimum length. For the complexity requirement setting to be effective
                                   the Group Policy setting Password must meet complexity requirements

                                   when unlocking a volume. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any
                                   of the protectors available on the drive.
                                    If you enable this policy setting, users can configure a password

                                   password, select Require password for removable data drive. To enforce
                                   complexity requirements on the password, select Require complexity.
                                    When set to Require complexity a connection to a domain controller
                                   is necessary when BitLocker is enabled to validate the complexity the
                                   password. When set to Allow complexity a connection to a domain
                                   controller will be attempted to validate the complexity adheres to the
                                   rules set by the policy, but if no domain controllers are found the
                                   password will still be accepted regardless of actual password complexity
                                   and the drive will be encrypted using that password as a protector. When
                                   set to Do not allow complexity, no password complexity validation will
                                   be done.
                                    Passwords must be at least 8 characters. To configure a greater
                                   minimum length for the password, enter the desired number of characters
                                   in the Minimum password length box.
                                    If you disable this policy setting, the user is not allowed to use a password.
                                    If you do not configure this policy setting, passwords will be
                                   supported with the default settings, which do not include password

                                   data drives. If you choose to allow use of a password, you can require a
                                   password to be used, enforce complexity requirements, and configure a
                                   minimum length. For the complexity requirement setting to be effective
                                   the Group Policy setting Password must meet complexity requirements
                                   located in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security
                                   Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\ must be also enabled.
                                    Note These settings are enforced when turning on BitLocker, not
                                   when unlocking a volume. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any
                                   of the protectors available on the drive.
                                    If you enable this policy setting, users can configure a password
                                   that meets the requirements that you define. To require the use of a
                                   password, select Require password for removable data drive. To enforce
                                   complexity requirements on the password, select Require complexity.
                                    When set to Require complexity a connection to a domain controller
                                   is necessary when BitLocker is enabled to validate the complexity the
                                   password. When set to Allow complexity a connection to a domain
                                   controller will be attempted to validate the complexity adheres to the
                                   rules set by the policy, but if no domain controllers are found the
                                   password will still be accepted regardless of actual password complexity
                                   and the drive will be encrypted using that password as a protector. When
                                   set to Do not allow complexity, no password complexity validation will
                                   be done.
                                    Passwords must be at least 8 characters. To configure a greater
                                   minimum length for the password, enter the desired number of characters
                                   in the Minimum password length box.
                                    If you disable this policy setting, the user is not allowed to use a password.
                                    If you do not configure this policy setting, passwords will be
                                   supported with the default settings, which do not include password
                                   complexity requirements and require only 8 characters.

                                      option to  20480 or greater . Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop
        recording information
                                      unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will
                                      overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate
                                      the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
                                      method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The
                                      consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed
                                      from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration,
                                      because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to
                                      overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat
                                      reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.
                                       Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a
                                      server that uses Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some other
                                      automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly
                                      important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server
                                      could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring
                                      server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the
                                      attacker's activities.

                                      unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will
                                      overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate
                                      the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
                                      method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The
                                      consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed
                                      from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration,
                                      because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to
                                      overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat
                                      reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.
                                       Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a
                                      server that uses Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some other
                                      automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly
                                      important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server
                                      could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring
                                      server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the
                                      attacker's activities.

                             this update service location to automatically update computers on your network.
                             The Automatic Updates client will search this service for updates that apply to
                             the computers on your network. To use the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                             service location setting, you must set two server name values the server from
                             which the Automatic Updates client detects and downloads updates, and the
                             server to which updated workstations upload statistics. You can set both values
                             to be the same server. If you enable the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                             service location setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect to the
                             specified intranet Microsoft update service server instead of Windows Update
                             to search for and download updates. This configuration allows end users in your
                             organization to avoid firewall issues, and provides you with an opportunity to
                             test updates before you deploy them. If you disable or do not configure this
                             policy setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect directly to the
                             Windows Update site on the Internet if Automatic Updates is not disabled by
                             Group Policy or user preference. Configure this setting in a manner that is
                             consistent with security and operational requirements of your
                             organization.

        This policy setting allows you to manage whether
                       users can manually remove the zone information from saved file attachments.
                       Typically, users can either click the Unblock button in the files Property sheet or
                       select a check box in the Security Warning dialog. If the zone information is
                       removed, users can open potentially dangerous file attachments that Windows has
                       prevented users from opening. When the Hide mechanisms to remove zone information
                       setting is enabled, Windows hides the check box and Unblock button. When this policy
                       setting is disabled, Windows displays the check box and the Unblock button. Configure
                       this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational
                       requirements of your organization. Note  To configure whether files are saved with zone information,
                       see the Do not preserve zone information in file attachments setting.
