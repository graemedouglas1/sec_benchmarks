    title: '1.1.1 | L1 Ensure Enforce password history is set to 24 or more passwords'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account
        before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default
        value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the
        effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing
        their password.
        The recommended state for this setting is              24 or more passwords
        .
    remediation: |
        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to                  24 or more password(s)
        :               Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password
        Policy\Enforce password history
         Impact: The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to
        change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk
        of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create
        passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make
        them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase
        administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

    title: '1.1.2 | L1 Ensure Maximum password age is set to 60 or fewer days but not 0'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting
        range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack
        passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password.
        However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to
        users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.
        The recommended state for this setting is              60 or fewer days, but not 0
        .

        :               Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password
        Policy\Maximum password age
         Impact: If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a
        configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location
        or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced
        because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of
        values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password
        changes. The default value for this setting is 0 days.
        The recommended state for this setting is              1 or more days
        .

        Policy\Minimum password age
         Impact: If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password when the user first
        logs on, the administrator must select the User must change password at next logon check box, or the user will not be
        able to change the password until the next day.

    title: '1.1.4 | L1 Ensure Minimum password length is set to 14 or more characters'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many
        different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps pass phrase is a
        better term than password. In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, pass phrases can be quite long and can include spaces.
        Therefore, a phrase such as I want to drink a 5 milkshake is a valid pass phrase it is a considerably stronger password
        than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated
        about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length.
        The recommended state for this setting is              14 or more characters
        .           Note
         In Windows 10 Release 1709 and older versions of Windows, the GUI of the Local Security Policy LSP, Local Group Policy
        Editor LGPE and Group Policy Management Editor GPME would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However,
        starting with Windows 10 Release 1803, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length.
    remediation: |
        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to                  14 or more character(s)
        :               Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password
        Policy\Minimum password length
         Impact: Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users
        might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords
        could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten
        passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass phrases, which are often easier
        to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note:
         Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14
        characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that
        use accounts that require long passwords.

  "1.1.5":
    title: '1.1.5 | L1 Ensure Password must meet complexity requirements is set to Enabled'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this
        policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements Not contain the users account name or parts of
        the users full name that exceed two consecutive characters Be at least six characters in length Contain characters from
        three of the following categories English uppercase characters A through Z English lowercase characters a through z Base
        10 digits 0 through 9 Nonalphabetic characters for example, !, , ,  A catchall category of any Unicode character that
        does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional
        character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a sevencharacter, all lowercase alphabetic
        password would have 267 approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second a
        capability of many passwordcracking utilities, it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A sevencharacter alphabetic
        password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A sevencharacter casesensitive alphanumeric password without
        punctuation has 627 combinations. An eightcharacter password has 268 or 2 x 1011 possible combinations. Although this
        might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible
        passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special
        keyboard characters such as ! or . Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force
        attack.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Enabled
        .
    remediation: |
        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to                  Enabled
        :               Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password
        Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements
         Impact: If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out
        accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However,
        all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has
        more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of
        arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper
        row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits
        between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password
        does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly
        enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an
        extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords
        to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard
        alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

    title: '1.1.6 | L1 Ensure Store passwords using reversible encryption is set to Disabled'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way that uses reversible encryption,
        which provides support for application protocols that require knowledge of the users password for authentication
        purposes. Passwords that are stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the
        passwords.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Disabled
        .

         Impact: If your organization uses either the CHAP authentication protocol through remote access or IAS services or
        Digest Authentication in IIS, you must configure this policy setting to Enabled. This setting is extremely dangerous to
        apply through Group Policy on a user-by-user basis, because it requires the appropriate user account object to be opened
        in Active Directory Users and Computers.

    section: 'Account Lockout Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is unlocked and a user can try
        to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable.
        If the value for this policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an
        administrator manually unlocks them. Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy
        setting to a high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk receives to
        unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time a lock remains in place, so that they
        realize they only need to call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.

         Impact: If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an

        you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by deliberately generating failed logons
        for multiple user, therefore you should also configure the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value. If you
        configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's attempt to discover passwords
        with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place.

    description: |
        This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold resets to zero. The default value
        for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than
        or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting. If you leave this policy setting at its default value or
        configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker
        could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their
        accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators.
        Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period

        out their accounts as described in the preceding paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter
        after setting, administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this policy setting to a
        reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after which their accounts would unlock automatically.

        This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system
        objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic
        link. A symbolic link is a pointer much like a shortcut or .lnk file to another file system object, which can be a file,
        folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only
        works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with
        symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
        Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For
        this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
        Administrators
         can create symbolic links.

        capability on production computers. If a problem arises that requires an application to be debugged on a production
        server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily and assign the                    Debug programs
         user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU.

        the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. If the Audit Shut down system

        This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component. Note
         When Windows Vistabased computers have this policy setting enabled and they connect to file or print shares on remote
        servers, it is important that the setting is synchronized with its companion setting,                Microsoft network
        server Digitally sign communications always
        , on those servers. For more information about these settings, see the Microsoft network client and server Digitally
        sign communications four related settings section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.

        Options\Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)
         Impact: The Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to
        perform SMB packet signing. The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP
        Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
        which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB
        signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the
        client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be
        signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small
        business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
        may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older
        applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
        computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

        It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client computers that run older
        versions of the Windows operating system such as Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95 will experience problems when they try
        to use resources on the server. Users who access file and print servers anonymously will be unable to list the shared
        network resources on those servers; the users will have to authenticate before they can view the lists of shared folders
        and printers. However, even with this policy setting enabled, anonymous users will have access to resources with

    section: 'Network security'
    description: |
        This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer. The Public Key Cryptography
        Based UsertoUser PKU2U protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support
        provider SSP. The SSP enables peertopeer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing
        feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.
        With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,                Spnego.dll
        . In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension
        SSP for Negotiate,                Negoexts.dll
        , which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.
        When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,                Negoexts.dll
         calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the
        policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to
        the logon peer for validation and associates the users certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

        will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 NTLMv2 variants, and
        is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations Join a
        domain Authenticate between Active Directory forests Authenticate to downlevel domains Authenticate to computers that do

        include 4960 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate
        a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the
        remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability
        problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this
        problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that
        failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963 IPsec
        dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing
        its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965 IPsec received a
        packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index SPI. This is usually caused by malfunctioning
        hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are
        the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec
        implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478 IPsec Services has
        started successfully. 5479 IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the
        computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5480 IPsec Services
        failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some
        of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor
        snapin to diagnose the problem. 5483 IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be
        started. 5484 IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services
        can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485 IPsec
        Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plugandplay event for network interfaces. This poses a potential
        security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

    section: 'LAPS'
    description: |
        In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution LAPS tool, which is free and supported
        software that allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on
        domainattached workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of the domain
        computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved Sysadmins when needed. The LAPS tool requires a
        small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side
        Extension CSE on targeted computers. Please see the LAPS documentation for details. LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer
        workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers  they must be joined
        to a domain. Note
         Organizations that utilize 3rdparty commercial software to manage unique  complex local Administrator passwords on
        domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.           Note 2
         LAPS is only designed to manage              local
         Administrator passwords, and is therefore not recommended or supported for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do
        not have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO
        settings to member servers and workstations.
    remediation: |
        In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is required, and a Group Policy Client Side Extension
        (CSE) must be installed on each managed computer. When LAPS is installed, the file                  AdmPwd.dll
         must be present in the following location and registered in Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation
        does this for you):               C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll
         Impact:
        No impact. When installed and registered properly,                    AdmPwd.dll
         takes no action unless given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refresh. It is not a memory-resident agent or
        service.                 In a disaster recovery scenario where Active Directory is not available, the local
        Administrator password will not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool (such as Microsoft's Disaster and
        Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be necessary.

        Internet Protocol version 6 IPv6 is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and
        over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking,
        hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.
        The recommended state for this setting is                  DisabledComponents  0xff 255

         This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.                   Note #2:

        Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm
        ) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning

        version, which is achieved by ensuring that all Microsoft security updates at least through May 2018 are installed.

        Remote host allows delegation of nonexportable credentials. When using credential delegation, devices provide an
        exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers
        on the remote host. The Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard features are two options to
        help protect against this risk.

    description: |
        This policy setting allows you to manage BitLockers use of hardwarebased encryption on fixed data drives and specify
        which encryption algorithms it can use with hardwarebased encryption. Using hardwarebased encryption can improve
        performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive. You can specify
        additional options that control whether BitLocker softwarebased encryption is used instead of hardwarebased encryption
        on computers that do not support hardwarebased encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and
        cipher suites used with hardwarebased encryption. Note
         The Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength policy setting does not apply to hardwarebased encryption. The
        encryption algorithm used by hardwarebased encryption is set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses
        the algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The Restrict encryption algorithms and cipher suites allowed
        for hardwarebased encryption option enables you to restrict the encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with
        hardware encryption. If the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable the use of
        hardwarebased encryption.               Encryption algorithms are specified by object identifiers OID. For example AES
        128 in CBC mode OID 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2 AES 256 in CBC mode OID 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.42

        This policy setting allows you to control how BitLockerprotected removable data drives are recovered in the absence of
        the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. The Allow data recovery agent check
        box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLockerprotected removable data drives. Before a
        Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management
        Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet
        for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents. In Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information
        select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48digit recovery password or a 256bit recovery
        key. Select Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard to prevent users from specifying recovery options when
        they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you
        enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting. In Save
        BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services choose which BitLocker recovery information to store
        in AD DS for removable data drives. If you select Backup recovery password and key package, both the BitLocker recovery

        drives check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and

    description: |
        This policy setting allows you to manage BitLockers use of hardwarebased encryption on removable data drives and specify
        which encryption algorithms it can use with hardwarebased encryption. Using hardwarebased encryption can improve
        performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive. You can specify
        additional options that control whether BitLocker softwarebased encryption is used instead of hardwarebased encryption
        on computers that do not support hardwarebased encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and
        cipher suites used with hardwarebased encryption. Note
         The Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength policy setting does not apply to hardwarebased encryption. The
        encryption algorithm used by hardwarebased encryption is set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses
        the algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The Restrict encryption algorithms and cipher suites allowed
        for hardwarebased encryption option enables you to restrict the encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with
        hardware encryption. If the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable the use of
        hardwarebased encryption.               Encryption algorithms are specified by object identifiers OID. For example AES
        128 in CBC mode OID 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2 AES 256 in CBC mode OID 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.42

        This policy setting allows you to manage BitLockers use of hardwarebased encryption on removable data drives and specify
        which encryption algorithms it can use with hardwarebased encryption. Using hardwarebased encryption can improve
        performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive. You can specify
        additional options that control whether BitLocker softwarebased encryption is used instead of hardwarebased encryption
        on computers that do not support hardwarebased encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and
        cipher suites used with hardwarebased encryption. Note
         The Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength policy setting does not apply to hardwarebased encryption. The
        encryption algorithm used by hardwarebased encryption is set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses
        the algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The Restrict encryption algorithms and cipher suites allowed
        for hardwarebased encryption option enables you to restrict the encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with
        hardware encryption. If the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable the use of
        hardwarebased encryption.               Encryption algorithms are specified by object identifiers OID. For example AES
        128 in CBC mode OID 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2 AES 256 in CBC mode OID 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.42

        The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit EMET is free and supported security software developed by Microsoft that
        allows an enterprise to apply exploit mitigations to applications that run on Windows. Many of these mitigations were
        later coded directly into Windows 10 and Server 2016. More information on EMET, including download and User Guide, can
        be obtained here Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit  EMET  TechNet Security Note
         Although EMET is quite effective at enhancing exploit protection on Windows workstation OSes prior to Windows 10, it is
        highly recommended that compatibility testing is done on typical workstation configurations including all CISrecommended
        EMET settings before widespread deployment to your environment.             Note 2
         EMET has been reported to be very problematic on 32bit OSes  we only recommend using it with 64bit OSes.
        Note 3
         Microsoft has announced that EMET will be EndOfLife EOL on July 31, 2018. This does not mean the software will stop
        working, only that Microsoft will not update it any further past that date, nor troubleshoot new problems with it. They
        are instead recommending that workstations be upgraded to Windows 10.
    remediation: |
        Install EMET 5.52 or higher.

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able
        to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able
        to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

         If your organization has decided to implement                      OneDrive for Business

        particular from that template are worth your consideration:                   Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only
        specific organizations
         - a computer-based setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only                        approved
         tenant IDs.                     Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts
         - a user-based setting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business).

        onnetwork clients can activate Microsoft Windows OS and/or their Microsoft Office via the KMS server instead of
        connecting directly to Microsoft. This policy setting lets you optout of sending KMS client activation data to Microsoft
        automatically.
        The recommended state for this setting is                Enabled
