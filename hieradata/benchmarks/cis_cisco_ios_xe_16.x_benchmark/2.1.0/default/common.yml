         Impact: Implementing Cisco AAA is significantly disruptive as former access methods are immediately disabled.
        Therefore, before implementing Cisco AAA, the organization should carefully review and plan their authentication
        criteria (logins & passwords, challenges & responses, and token technologies), authorization methods, and accounting
        requirements.

        the contents of routing updates. The Cisco IOS software stops checking the extended access list after a match occurs.
    remediation: |

        Enable secret password type 5 and enable secret password type 5 must be migrated to the stronger password type 8 or 9.
        IF a device is upgraded from IOS XE 16.9 or later the type 5 is auto converted to type 9. Use the enable secret command
        to provide an additional layer of security over the enable password. The enable secret command provides better security
        by storing the enable secret password using a nonreversible cryptographic function. The added layer of security
        encryption provides is useful in environments where the password crosses the network or is stored on a TFTP server.
    remediation: |
        Configure a strong, enable secret password. hostname(config)#enable secret 9 {ENABLE_SECRET_PASSWORD}
         Impact: Default device configuration does not require strong user authentication potentially enabling unfettered access
        to an attacker that is able to reach the device. Creating a local account with an encrypted password enforces login
        authentication and provides a fallback authentication mechanism for configuration in a named method list in a situation
        where centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting services are unavailable. The following is the type of
        encryption the device will allow as of 15.3: Type 0 this mean the password will not be encrypted when router store it in
        Run/Start Files command: enable password cisco123 Type 4 this mean the password will be encrypted when router store it
        in Run/Start Files using SHA-256 which apps like Cain can crack but will take long time command : enable secret 4
        Rv4kArhts7yA2xd8BD2YTVbts (notice above is not the password string it self but the hash of the password) this type is
        deprecated starting from IOS 15.3(3) Type 5
         this mean the password will be encrypted when router store it in Run/Start Files using MD5 which apps like Cain can
        crack but will take long time command: enable secret 5 00271A5307542A02D22842 (notice above is not the password string
        it self but the hash of the password) or enable secret cisco123 (notice above is the password string it self)
        Type 7
         this mean the password will be encrypted when router store it in Run/Start Files using Vigenere cipher which any
        website with type7 reverser can crack it in less than one second command : ena password cisco123 service password-
        encryption                 Type 8 this mean the password will be encrypted when router store it in Run/Start Files using
        PBKDF2-SHA-256 starting from IOS 15.3(3). Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) with Secure Hash Algorithm,
        26-bits (SHA-256) as the hashing algorithm Example :
        R1(config)#enable algorithm-type sha256 secret cisco R1(config)#do sh run | i enable enable secret 8
        $8$mTj4RZG8N9ZDOk$elY/asfm8kD3iDmkBe3hD2r4xcA/0oWS5V3os.O91u. Example :

        secret 8 $8$dsYGNam3K1SIJO$7nv/35M/qr6t.dVc7UY9zrJDWRVqncHub1PE9UlMQFs Type 9 this means the password will be encrypted
        when router store it in Run/Start Files using scrypt as the hashing algorithm. starting from IOS 15.3(3) Example :
        R1(config)#ena algorithm-type scrypt secret cisco R1(config)#do sh run | i enable enable secret 9
        $9$WnArItcQHW/uuE$x5WTLbu7PbzGDuv0fSwGKS/KURsy5a3WCQckmJp0MbE Example :

        secret 9 $9$nhEmQVczB7dqsO$X.HsgL6x1il0RxkOSSvyQYwucySCt7qFm4v7pqCxkKM Important Notes: 1-If you configure type 8 or
        type 9 passwords and then downgrade to a release that does not support type 8 and type 9 passwords, you must configure
        the type 5 passwords before downgrading. If not, you are locked out of the device and a password recovery is required.
        2-Starting from IOS 15.3(3)The 4 keyword was deprecated and support for type 8 and type 9 algorithms were added and The
        warning message for removal of support for the type 4 algorithm was added

        Configure the Message Digest option for OSPF.

                         Impact: Organizations should plan and implement enterprise security policies that require rigorous
        authentication methods for routing protocols. Configuring the area 'authentication message-digest' for OSPF enforces
        these policies by restricting exchanges between network devices.

                         Impact: Organizations should plan and implement enterprise security policies that require rigorous
        authentication methods for routing protocols. Using the 'neighbor password' for BGP enforces these policies by
        restricting the type of authentication between network devices.
