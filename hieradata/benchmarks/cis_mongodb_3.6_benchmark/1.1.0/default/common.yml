    section: 'Authentication'
    description: |
        This setting ensures that all clients, users, servers are required to authenticate before being granted access to the
        MongoDB database. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client. When access control, i.e.
        authorization, is enabled, MongoDB requires all clients to authenticate themselves in order to determine their access.
        To authenticate as a user, you must provide a username, password, and the authentication database associated with that
        user.
    remediation: |
        The authentication mechanism should be implemented before anyone accesses the MongoDB Server. To enable the
        authentication mechanism:
        Start the MongoDB instance without authentication.
                         mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1


        Or
                         mongod.exe --port 27017 --dbpath db1


        Create the system user administrator, ensuring that its password meets organizationally-defined password complexity
        requirements.

        Open                  mongod.conf

        to enable authorization before creating the first user in the system. When active, the localhost exception allows all
        connections from the localhost interface to have full access to that instance. The exception applies only when there are

    section: 'Authentication'
    description: |
        Authentication is enabled in a sharded cluster when the certificate or key files are created and configured for all
        components. This ensures that every client that accesses the cluster must provide credentials, to include MongoDB
        instances that access each other within the cluster. With keyfile authentication, each mongod or mongos instance in the
        sharded cluster uses the contents of the keyfile as the shared password for authenticating other members in the
        deployment. Only mongod or mongos instances with the correct keyfile can join the sharded cluster. For Production
        Environment
         x.509 certificate authentication with secure TSL/SSL connection must be used for authentication.         For
        Development Purpose
         Key file can be used as an authentication mechanism between the shared cluster. Keyfiles are bareminimum forms of
        security and are best suited for testing or development environments.
    remediation: |
        To authenticate to servers, clients can use x.509 certificates instead of usernames and passwords.
        MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure TLS/SSL connection. The x.509 client
        authentication allows clients to authenticate to servers with certificates rather than with a username and password.
        Change the configuration file                /etc/mongod.conf
         on each host, adding the following rows:
        net:
           port: 27017
           ssl:
              mode: requireSSL

              clusterAuthMode: x509
                     Restart the daemon sudo service mongodb restart

        To enable authentication in the sharded cluster, perform the following steps:(               Only for Development
        Purpose
        )             Generate A Key File
        On each component in the shared cluster, enable authentication by editing the configuration file

        . Set the                  keyFile
         option to the key file’s path and then start the component with this command:
                         keyFile = /srv/mongodb/keyfile


        When starting the component, set                  --keyFile
         option, which is an option for both                  mongos
         instances and                  mongod
         instances. Set the                  --keyFile
         to the key file’s path.

        Rolebased access control RBAC is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users
        within an enterprise. A user is granted one or more roles that determine the users access to database resources and
        operations. Outside of role assignments, the user has no access to the system. MongoDB can use RBAC to govern access to
        MongoDB systems. MongoDB does not enable authorization by default.
    remediation: |
        Establish roles for MongoDB. Assign the appropriate privileges to each role. Assign the appropriate users to each role.

        For administrators of MongoDB, the following capabilities are important Limiting incoming traffic on a specific port to
        specific systems Limiting incoming traffic from untrusted hosts.
        On Linux systems, the            iptables

    section: 'Operating System Hardening'
    description: |
        Changing the default port used by MongoDB makes it harder for attackers to find the database and target it.
    remediation: |
        Change the port for MongoDB server to a number other than                27017
        .             Impact: Hackers frequently scan IP addresses for commonly used ports, so it's not uncommon to use a
        different port to "fly under the radar". This is just to avoid detection, other than that there is no added safety by
        using a different port.

        Every deployment may have unique requirements and settings. Recommended thresholds and settings are particularly
        important for MongoDB deployments: f
         (file size): unlimited               t
         (cpu time): unlimited               v
         (virtual memory): unlimited [1]               n
         (open files): 64000               m
         (memory size): unlimited [1] [2]               u
         (processes/threads): 64000
        Restart the mongod and mongos instances after changing the                ulimit
         settings to ensure that the changes take effect.

        MongoDB supports the execution of JavaScript code for certain serverside operations            mapReduce
        ,            group
        , and            where
        . If you do not use these operations, serverside scripting should be disabled.
    remediation: |
        If server-side scripting is not required, disable it by using the                --noscripting
         option on the command line.

        on the certificate or keyfile will prevent unauthorized access to it.
