         filesystem type is a compressed readonly Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems. A                cramfs
         image can be used without having to first decompress the image.

        Edit or create a file in the                    /etc/modprobe.d/
         directory ending in .conf

    section: 'Filesystem Configuration'
    description: |
        The              /tmp
         directory is a worldwritable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications.
    remediation: |
        Create or update an entry for                  /tmp
         in either                  /etc/fstab
                         OR
         in a systemd                  tmp.mount
         file:               If /etc/fstab
         is used: configure                  /etc/fstab
          as appropriate.               Example: tmpfs	/tmp	tmpfs     defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime  0 0

        Run the following command to remount                  /tmp
                       # mount -o remount,noexec,nodev,nosuid /tmp
         OR
         if systemd                  tmp.mount
         file is used:
        Run the following command to create the file                  /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount
         if it doesn't exist:               # [ ! -f /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount ] && cp -v /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount
        /etc/systemd/system/

        Edit the file                  /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount
        :
        [Mount]
        What=tmpfs
        Where=/tmp
        Type=tmpfs
        Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid
                       Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon: # systemctl daemon-reload

        Run the following command to unmask and start                  tmp.mount
        :
        # systemctl unmask tmp.mount
        # systemctl --now enable tmp.mount
                       Impact:
        Since the                    /tmp
         directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate
        partition.                 Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it,
        but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a
        single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can
        lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the
        size={size} parameter on the Options line on the tmp.mount file

         and              ClientAliveCountMax
         control the timeout of ssh sessions.           ClientAliveInterval
         sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message
        through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages
        will not be sent to the client.             ClientAliveCountMax
         sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If
        this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the
        session. The default value is                3
        .
                       The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel

         is set to 15, and                ClientAliveCountMax
