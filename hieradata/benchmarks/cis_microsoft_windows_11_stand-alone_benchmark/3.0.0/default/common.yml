    title: '1.1.1 | L1 Ensure Enforce password history is set to 24 or more passwords'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account
        before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default
        value for standalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 passwords. To
        maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly
        changing their password.
        The recommended state for this setting is              24 or more passwords
        .           Note
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the
        Default Domain Policy
         GPO in order to be globally in effect on              domain
         user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect
        local
         user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and
        account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects
        PSOs, which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative
        Center.           Note 2
         As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum limit of 24 saved passwords. For more
        information, please visit              Enforce password history Windows 10  Windows security  Microsoft Docs

        Policy\Enforce password history
         Impact: The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to
        change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk
        of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create
        passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make
        them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase
        administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

        This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting
        range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack
        passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password.
        However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to
        users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.
        The recommended state for this setting is              365 or fewer days, but not 0

        Policy\Maximum password age
         Impact: If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a
        configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location
        or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced
        because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

    title: '1.1.4 | L1 Ensure Minimum password length is set to 14 or more characters'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many
        different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps passphrase is a
        better term than password. In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces.
        Therefore, a phrase such as I want to drink a 5 milkshake is a valid passphrase it is a considerably stronger password
        than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated
        about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments,
        the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet
        your organizations business requirements.
        The recommended state for this setting is              14 or more characters
        .           Note
         In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy LSP, Local Group
        Policy Editor LGPE and Group Policy Management Editor GPME would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters.
        However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password
        length.           Note 2
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the

        :               Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password
        Policy\Minimum password length
         Impact: Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users
        might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords
        could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten
        passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to
        remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note:
         Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14
        characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that
        use accounts that require long passwords.

    title: '1.1.5 | L1 Ensure Password must meet complexity requirements is set to Enabled'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this
        policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements Not contain the users account name or parts of
        the users full name that exceed two consecutive characters Be at least six characters in length
        Contain characters from three of the following categories
                       English uppercase characters A through Z English lowercase characters a through z Base 10 digits 0
        through 9 Nonalphabetic characters for example, !, , ,  A catchall category of any Unicode character that does not fall
        under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.
                           Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a
        sevencharacter, all lowercase alphabetic password would have 26 to the power of 7 approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9
        or 8 billion possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second a capability of many passwordcracking utilities, it
        would only take 133 minutes to crack. A sevencharacter alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of
        7 combinations. A sevencharacter casesensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An
        eightcharacter password has 26 to the power of 8 or 2 x 10 to the power of 11 possible combinations. Although this might
        seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords.
        Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard
        characters such as ! or . Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Enabled
        .           Note

        Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements
         Impact: If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out
        accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However,
        all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has
        more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of
        arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper
        row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits
        between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password
        does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly
        enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an
        extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords
        to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard
        alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

         Impact: If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an
        administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting may generate additional help desk calls. If
        you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by deliberately generating failed logons
        for multiple user, therefore you should also configure the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value. If you
        configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's attempt to discover passwords
        with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place.

        or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting. If you leave this policy setting at its default value or
        configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker
        could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their
        accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators.
        Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period
        until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.

    title: '2.2.14 | L1 Configure Create symbolic links'
    section: 'User Rights Assignment'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system
        objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic
        link. A symbolic link is a pointer much like a shortcut or .lnk file to another file system object, which can be a file,
        folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only
        works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with
        symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
        Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For
        this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
        Administrators
         can create symbolic links.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Administrators

         Impact:
        If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical circumstances rarely require this
        capability on production computers. If a problem arises that requires an application to be debugged on a production
        server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily and assign the                    Debug programs
         user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU.
        The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the                    Debug programs
         user right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail.
        Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not owned by the person who runs the
        tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tool                    Kill.exe

        the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. If the Audit Shut down system
        immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative
        burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not

        they backed up or restored data to become a denial of service DoS vulnerability, because a server could be forced to
        shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also,
        because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or

        If you select                      Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session
        , removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the

        signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the

        session is suspended because of inactivity. Administrators can use this policy setting to control when a computer
        suspends an inactive SMB session. If client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished. The maximum
        value is 99999, which is over 69 days in effect, this value disables the setting.
        The recommended state for this setting is                15 or fewer minutes

        Options\Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)
         Impact: The Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client unless that client agrees to
        perform SMB packet signing. The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP
        Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
        which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB
        signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the
        client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be
        signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small
        business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
        may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older
        applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
        computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

         Impact: All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. This
        setting affects the server SMB behavior, and its implementation should be carefully evaluated and tested to prevent
        disruptions to file and print serving capabilities.
        If configured to                      Accept if provided by client
        , the SMB server will accept and validate the SPN provided by the SMB client and allow a session to be established if it
        matches the SMB server’s list of SPN’s for itself. If the SPN does NOT match, the session request for that SMB client
        will be denied.
        If configured to                      Required from client

        This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer. The Public Key Cryptography
        Based UsertoUser PKU2U protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support
        provider SSP. The SSP enables peertopeer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing
        feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.
        With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,                Spnego.dll
        . In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension
        SSP for Negotiate,                Negoexts.dll
        , which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.
        When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,                Negoexts.dll
         calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the
        policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to
        the logon peer for validation and associates the users certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

    description: |
        LAN Manager LM was a family of early Microsoft client/server software predating Windows NT that allowed users to link
        personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing,
        user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the
        default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory
        will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 NTLMv2 variants, and
        is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations Join a
        domain Authenticate between Active Directory forests Authenticate to downlevel domains Authenticate to computers that do
        not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The
        Network security LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is
        used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session
        security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.

        This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security IPsec driver. Events for this subcategory
        include 4960 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate
        a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the
        remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability
        problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this
        problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that
        failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963 IPsec
        dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing
        its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965 IPsec received a
        packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index SPI. This is usually caused by malfunctioning
        hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are
        the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec
        implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478 IPsec Services has
        started successfully. 5479 IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the
        computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5480 IPsec Services
        failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some
        of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor
        snapin to diagnose the problem. 5483 IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be
        started. 5484 IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services
        can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485 IPsec
        Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plugandplay event for network interfaces. This poses a potential
        security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

        reset when responses resume. The base timeout value is dynamically determined by the measured roundtrip time on the
        connection.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Enabled 3

                              Impact: TCP starts a retransmission timer when each outbound segment is passed to the IP. If no
        acknowledgment is received for the data in a given segment before the timer expires, then the segment is retransmitted
        up to three times.

        If the option                      Enabled: Require DoH

        encrypted while in transit. The Require DoH option could also lead to domain-joined systems not functioning properly
        within the environment.
        The option                      Enabled: Allow DoH
         will perform DoH queries if the configured DNS servers support it. If they don´t support it, classic name resolution

        To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to                      0xff (255) (DWORD)
        :                   HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:DisabledComponents
         Note:
         This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.                   Note #2:
         Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (
        Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm
        ) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning
        off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not "undo" the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting
        must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state.                   Impact: Connectivity to other
        systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of
        Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.
        This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852:                        How to disable
        IPv6 or its components in Windows
        .                     Note:
         This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.

        Impact:
        Choosing the                      Secure Boot
         option provides the system with as much protection as is supported by the computer’s hardware. A system with
        input/output memory management units (IOMMUs) will have Secure Boot with DMA protection. A system without IOMMUs will
        simply have Secure Boot enabled without DMA protection.
        Choosing the                      Secure Boot with DMA protection
         option requires the system to have IOMMUs in order to enable VBS. Without IOMMU hardware support, VBS will be disabled.

        This policy setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that
        Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows
        Windows to install a device. If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose
        hardware ID or compatible ID appears in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop
        server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote
        desktop server. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and updated as allowed
        or prevented by other policy settings.
        The recommended state for this setting is                  PCI\CC0C0A
                              Note
         This device ID is for Thunderbolt controllers. The USB TypeC USBC port standard that is now common in many computers,
        especially laptops, utilizes Thunderbolt technology, and therefore may be affected by this restriction. If your
        organization needs to use USBC extensively, you may need to decide, internally, to allow yourselves an exception to this
        recommendation. However, please ensure that all necessary decisionmakers have accepted the increased risk of BitLocker
        encryption key theft and therefore data theft via malicious Thunderbolt devices when left unattended, by doing so.
        Note 2
         In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 or newer, there is a new control named                  Enumeration policy for
        external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection
         available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may perform Direct Memory Access DMA attacks. The
        newer control is also now part of the Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still

        or audio media to start immediately. An attacker could use this feature to launch a program to damage the computer or
        data on the computer. Autoplay is disabled by default on some removable drive types, such as floppy disk and network
        drives, but not on CDROM drives. Note
         You cannot use this policy setting to enable Autoplay on computer drives in which it is disabled by default, such as
        floppy disk and network drives.

        This policy setting allows you to configure whether Secure Boot will be allowed as the platform integrity provider for

        This policy setting allows you to control how BitLockerprotected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of
        the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. Select the Do not
        enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives check box if you want to
        prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker
        recovery information to AD DS succeeds. Note
         If the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives check box is
        selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.
        The recommended state for this setting is                  Enabled True
         checked.

        If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM check box.
        In this mode a USB drive is required for startup and the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB
        drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is
        accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access

        added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can
        also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4digit to 20digit personal
        identification number PIN, or both. Users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard. Note 2
         If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the

        This policy setting allows you to control how BitLockerprotected removable data drives are recovered in the absence of
        the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. The Allow data recovery agent check
        box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLockerprotected removable data drives. Before a
        Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management
        Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet
        for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents. In Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information
        select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48digit recovery password or a 256bit recovery
        key. Select Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard to prevent users from specifying recovery options when
        they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you
        enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting. In Save
        BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services choose which BitLocker recovery information to store
        in AD DS for removable data drives. If you select Backup recovery password and key package, both the BitLocker recovery
        password and key package are stored in AD DS. If you select Backup recovery password only, only the recovery password is
        stored in AD DS. Select the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data
        drives check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and
        the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds. Note
         If the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives check box is

        a large scale - to see if vendor firmware and/or driver updates are first required.

    section: 'BitLocker Drive Encryption'
    description: |
        This policy setting allows you to block direct memory access DMA for all hot pluggable PCI downstream ports until a user
        logs into Windows.
        The recommended state for this setting is                Enabled
        .             Note
         Microsoft changed the implementation of this setting in Windows 10 R1709 to strengthen its enforcement. As a result,
        some hardware configurations may experience unexpected problems with this setting in that release or newer, until
        updated firmware and/or drivers from the vendor are installed to correct the problem. See the Impact Statement for more
        information.
    remediation: |
        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to                    Enabled
        :                 Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive

         that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1703 Administrative Templates (or newer).
        Impact:
        Newly attached hardware devices that use DMA will not function on a locked (or signed out) workstation until the user
        has unlocked the session or logged in. Some hardware configurations may experience unexpected problems with this setting
        in Windows 10 R1709 (or newer), requiring updated firmware and/or drivers to correct the problem. See
        MSKB 4057300
         for more information. We recommend testing this setting on all examples of workstation hardware before deploying it on
        a large scale - to see if vendor firmware and/or driver updates are first required.

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able
        to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

        The recommended state for this setting is                Enabled
        .

        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to                    Enabled
        :                 Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\OneDrive\Prevent the usage

         Note:
         This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template                    SkyDrive.admx/adml
         that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server 2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer). However, we
        strongly recommend you only use the version included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1607 & Server 2016
        Administrative Templates (or newer). Older versions of the templates had conflicting settings in different template
        files for both OneDrive & SkyDrive, until it was cleaned up properly in the above version.                 Note #2:
         In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was named                    Prevent the usage of
        SkyDrive for file storage
        , but it was renamed starting with the Windows 10 RTM (Release 1507) Administrative Templates.                 Impact:
        Users can't access OneDrive from the OneDrive app and file picker. Windows Store apps can't access OneDrive using the
        WinRT
         API. OneDrive doesn't appear in the navigation pane in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the
        cloud. Users can't automatically upload photos and videos from the camera roll folder.                   Note:
         If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users from saving files to
        OneDrive/SkyDrive.                   Note #2:
         If your organization has decided to implement                      OneDrive for Business
         and therefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you also obtain and utilize the
        OneDrive.admx/adml
         template that is bundled with the latest OneDrive client, as noted                      at this link
         (this template is not included with the Windows Administrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in
        particular from that template are worth your consideration:                   Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only
        specific organizations
         - a computer-based setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only                        approved
         tenant IDs.                     Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts
         - a user-based setting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business).

         By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established
        the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the
        Server authentication certificate template
         setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate
        template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a
        valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the workstation for it to work.
        Note #2:
         Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this
        setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before

        host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon
        screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon”
