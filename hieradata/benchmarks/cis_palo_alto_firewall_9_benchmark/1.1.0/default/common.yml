    section: 'Ensure System Logging to a Remote Host'
    description: |
        Syslog logging is a standard logging protocol that is widely supported.  It is recommended for a level 1 deployment
        only, as syslog does not support encryption.

                                 Impact: Failure to properly store and archive logs for critical infrastructure leaves an
        organization without the tools required to establish trends in events or activity, or to retrospectively analyze
        security or operational events beyond the log timespan stored on the firewall.
        Not having remote logs also puts many organizations outside of compliance with many regulatory frameworks.  Finally, not
        logging to a remote host leaves organizations without recourse in the event of a compromise of logs on the primary
        device.
        It is imperative that organizations log critical infrastructure appropriately, store and archive these logs in a central
        location, and have a robust set of tools to analyze logs both in real time and after the fact.

        alternative. Impact: Simple passwords make an attacker's job very easy.  There is a reasonably short list of commonly
        used admin passwords for network infrastructure, not enforcing password lengths and complexity can lend itself to making
        an attacker's brute force attack successful.

        A longer password will almost always have a more positive impact than a shorter but more complex password.

        passwords need to be changed frequently. Administrative credentials should not be shared across multiple devices.  In a

        from a trusted source. In almost cases this means a trusted Public Certificate Authority, as in most cases remote access
        VPN users will not have access to any Private Certificate Authorities for Certificate validation. The certificate should
        have a valid date. It should not have a to date in the past it should not be expired, and should not have a from date in
        the future. The key length used to encrypt the certificate should be 2048 bits or more. The hash used to sign the
        certificate should be SHA2 or better. When the Certificate is applied, the TLS version should be 1.1 or higher 1.2 is
        recommended

        1.1 or 1.2 (1.2 is recommended). Impact: Not using a trusted Certificate, issued by a trusted Public Certificate
        Authority means that clients establishing VPN sessions will always see an error indicating an untrusted Certificate.
        This means that they will have no method of validating if their VPN session is being hijacked by a "Monkey in the
        Middle" (MitM) attack.  It also "trains" them to bypass certificate warnings for other services, making MitM attacks
        easier for those other services as well.

        its recommended to set some or all of these values to the maximum.

        enough to account for "large" files, but not large enough to affect performance of the hardware. In PAN-OS 9.x, the
        default file sizes for WildFire are: pe (Portable Executable) - 16MB apk (Android Application)- 10MB pdf (Portable
        Document Format) - 3072KB ms-office (Microsoft Office) — 16384KB jar (Packaged Java class file) — 5MB flash (Adobe
        Flash) — 5MB MacOSX (DMG/MAC-APP/MACH-O PKG files) — 10MB archive (RAR and 7z files) — 50MB linux (ELF files) — 50MB
        script (JScript, VBScript, PowerShell, and Shell Script)-  20KB In PAN-OS 9.x, the maximum file sizes for Wildfire are:
        pe (Portable Executable) - 50MB apk (Android Application)- 50MB pdf (Portable Document Format) - 51200KB ms-office
        (Microsoft Office) — 51200KB jar (Packaged Java class file) — 20MB flash (Adobe Flash) — 10MB MacOSX (DMG/MAC-APP/MACH-O

        lower than is typical for each file size.

        Enhanced Security Recommendation
        Require specific application policies when allowing            any
         traffic, regardless of the trust level of a zone.  Do not rely solely on port permissions. This may require SSL
        interception, and may also not be possible in all environments.

         and                Service
         values to match the exposed application.  For instance, for a web server exposed to the internet from a DMZ:
                       Source
         tab:                Zone
         set to                OUTSIDE

        Set these values for Policies on all Interfaces, for traffic in all directions.  For each                Security Policy
        , set the                Application
         and                Service
         values to match the exposed application.             Impact:
        Setting application based rules on both inbound and outbound traffic ensures that the traffic on the protocol and port
        being specified is actually the application that you expect.  For outbound traffic, the days of "we trust our users" is
        well past us, that statement also implies that we trust the malware on the user workstations, which is obviously not the
        case.

        For traffic from trusted to less trusted interfaces, the applications should be characterized over time, with the end
        goal being that all applications in in the rules, and a final "block all" rule is in place.
        Not having this goal gives both attackers and malware the leeway they need to accomplish their goals.

        Trusting only Port permissions to control traffic exposes an organization to "tunneling" style attacks that can
        exfiltrate data or facilitate Command and Control (C2) sessions.

        The CA Certificate used for inline HTTP Man in the Middle should be trusted by target users. For            SSL Forward
        Proxy
         configurations, there are classes of users that need to be considered.         1 Users that are members of the
        organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA
        Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group
        Policies for instance. A MDM Mobile Device Manager can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as
        telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or IoT Internet of Things
        devices. 2 Users that are not member of the organization  often these are classed as Visitors in the policies of the
        organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second
        approach is to not decrypt affected traffic  this is easily done, but leaves the majority of visitor traffic uninspected
        and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same
        certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the
        issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.
