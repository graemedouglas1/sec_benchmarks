    title: '1.1.1 | Ensure Enforce password history is set to 24 or more passwords'
    section: 'Password Policy'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account
        before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default
        value for standalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 passwords. To
        maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly
        changing their password.
        The recommended state for this setting is              24 or more passwords
        .           Note
         Password Policy settings section 1.1 and Account Lockout Policy settings section 1.2 must be applied via the
        Default Domain Policy
         GPO in order to be globally in effect on              domain
         user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect
        local
         user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and
        account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects
        PSOs, which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative
        Center.           Note 2
         As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum limit of 24 saved passwords. For more

        Policy\Enforce password history
         Impact: The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to
        change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk
        of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create
        passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make
        them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase
        administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

        1,000,000 attempts per second a capability of many passwordcracking utilities, it would only take 133 minutes to crack.
        A sevencharacter alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A sevencharacter
        casesensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 62 to the power of 7 combinations. An eightcharacter
        password has 26 to the power of 8 or 2 x 1011 possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at
        1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will
        significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as ! or . Proper

        between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password
        does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly
        enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an
        extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords
        to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard
        alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

        This policy setting determines which users or groups have the right to log on as a Remote Desktop Services client. If
        your organization uses Remote Assistance as part of its help desk strategy, create a group and assign it this user right
        through Group Policy. If the help desk in your organization does not use Remote Assistance, assign this user right only
        to the              Administrators
         group or use the Restricted Groups feature to ensure that no user accounts are part of the              Remote Desktop

         was known as              Terminal Services

        folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only
        works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with
        symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
        Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For
        this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only

        This policy setting determines which user accounts will have the right to attach a debugger to any process or to the
        kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components. Developers who are
        debugging their own applications do not need to be assigned this user right however, developers who are debugging new
        system components will need it.
        The recommended state for this setting is              Administrators
        .           Note
         This user right is considered a sensitive privilege for the purposes of auditing.

         Impact:
        If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical circumstances rarely require this
        capability on production computers. If a problem arises that requires an application to be debugged on a production
        server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily and assign the                    Debug programs
         user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU.
        The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the                    Debug programs
         user right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail.
        Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not owned by the person who runs the
        tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tool                    Kill.exe
         requires this user right for administrators to terminate processes that they did not start.

    description: |
        The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user or another specified account so
        that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized
        user will not be able to convince a client to connectfor example, by remote procedure call RPC or named pipesto a
        service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the unauthorized users permissions to
        administrative or system levels. Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the builtin Service group
        added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run
        under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are
        assigned this user right when they are started. Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following
        conditions exist The access token that is being impersonated is for this user. The user, in this logon session, logged
        on to the network with explicit credentials to create the access token. The requested level is less than Impersonate,
        such as Anonymous or Identify.
        An attacker with the              Impersonate a client after authentication
         user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client
        to elevate the attackers level of access to that of the client.

        This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement
        for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria TCSECC2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events
        from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the
        system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled,
        the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. If the Audit Shut down system
        immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative
        burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not
        overwrite events clear log manually. This configuration causes a repudiation threat a backup operator could deny that
        they backed up or restored data to become a denial of service DoS vulnerability, because a server could be forced to
        shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also,
        because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or
        data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs,
        it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer

        If you select                      Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session

         (or, if applicable for your environment,                    Force Logoff
         or                    Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session

        Options\Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior
         Impact:
        If you select                      Lock Workstation
        , the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with
        them, and still maintain a protected session.
        If you select                      Force Logoff
        , users are automatically logged off when their smart card is removed.
        If you select                      Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session
        , removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the
        smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on
        again. If the session is local, this policy will function identically to                      Lock Workstation
        .                   Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers in order to
        perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if network administrators are limited to
        a single account but need to log into several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network
        enforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time. For these reasons it is recommended that
        this setting only be enforced on workstations used for purposes commonly associated with typical users such as document
        creation and email.

        Options\Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)
         Impact: The Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client unless that client agrees to
        perform SMB packet signing. The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP
        Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication,
        which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB
        signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the
        client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be
        signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small
        business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
        may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older
        applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
        computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

        the service principal name SPN that is provided by the client computer when it establishes a session using the server
        message block SMB protocol. The server message block SMB protocol provides the basis for file and print sharing and
        other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. The SMB protocol supports validating the SMB server
        service principal name SPN within the authentication blob provided by a SMB client to prevent a class of attacks against
        SMB servers referred to as SMB relay attacks. This setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2.

         Impact: All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. This
        setting affects the server SMB behavior, and its implementation should be carefully evaluated and tested to prevent
        disruptions to file and print serving capabilities.
        If configured to                      Accept if provided by client
        , the SMB server will accept and validate the SPN provided by the SMB client and allow a session to be established if it
        matches the SMB server’s list of SPN’s for itself. If the SPN does NOT match, the session request for that SMB client
        will be denied.
        If configured to                      Required from client
        , the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in session setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is
        being requested to establish a connection. If no SPN is provided by client, or the SPN provided does not match, the
        session is denied.

        include 4960 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate
        a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the
        remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability
        problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this
        problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that
        failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963 IPsec
        dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing
        its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965 IPsec received a
        packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index SPI. This is usually caused by malfunctioning
        hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are
        the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec
        implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478 IPsec Services has
        started successfully. 5479 IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the
        computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5480 IPsec Services
        failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some
        of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor

        can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485 IPsec

    section: 'LAPS'
    description: |
        In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution LAPS tool, which is free and supported
        software that allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on
        domainattached workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of the domain
        computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved Sysadmins when needed. The LAPS tool requires a
        small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side
        Extension CSE on targeted computers. Please see the LAPS documentation for details. LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer
        workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers  they must be joined
        to a domain. Note
         Organizations that utilize thirdparty commercial software to manage unique  complex local Administrator passwords on
        domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.           Note 2
         LAPS is only designed to manage              local
         Administrator passwords, and is therefore not recommended or supported for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do
        not have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO
        settings to member servers and workstations.
    remediation: |
        In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is required, and a Group Policy Client Side Extension
        (CSE) must be installed on each managed computer. When LAPS is installed, the file                  AdmPwd.dll
         must be present in the following location and registered in Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation
        does this for you):               C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll
         Impact:
        No impact. When installed and registered properly,                    AdmPwd.dll
         takes no action unless given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refresh. It is not a memory-resident agent or
        service.                 In a disaster recovery scenario where Active Directory is not available, the local
        Administrator password will not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool (such as Microsoft's Disaster and
        Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be necessary.

        domainattached workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of the domain

        server WINS. The Mnode mixed method broadcasts first, then queries a name server WINS if broadcast failed. The Hnode
        hybrid method queries a name server WINS first, then broadcasts if the query failed.

        The option                      Enabled: Allow DoH
         will perform DoH queries if the configured DNS servers support it. If they don´t support it, classic name resolution

        This policy setting specifies a set of parameters for controlling the Windows NTP Client.
        The recommended STIG state for this setting is                  Enabled NT5DS
        .               Note
         Domainjoined systems use NT5DS to synchronize time from other systems in the domain by default.               The
        following settings are available to configure NtpServer
         The Domain Name System DNS name or IP address of an NTP time source. This value is in the form of
        dnsName,flags
         where                  flags
         is a hexadecimal bitmask of the flags for that host. For more information, see the NTP Client Group Policy Settings
        Associated with Windows Time section of the Windows Time Service Group Policy Settings. The default value is
        time.windows.com,0x09
        .               Type
         This value controls the authentication that W32time uses. The default value is NT5DS.               CrossSiteSyncFlags
         This value, expressed as a bitmask, controls how W32time chooses time sources outside its own site. The possible values
        are 0, 1, and 2.                  Setting this value to 0 None indicates that the time client should not attempt to
        synchronize time outside its site.
         Setting this value to 1 PdcOnly indicates that only the computers that function as primary domain controller PDC
        emulator operations masters in other domains can be used as synchronization partners when the client has to synchronize
        time with a partner outside its own site. Setting a value of 2 All indicates that any synchronization partner can be
        used. This value is ignored if the NT5DS value is not set. The default value is 2 decimal 0x02 hexadecimal.
        ResolvePeerBackoffMinutes
         This value, expressed in minutes, controls how long W32time waits before it attempts to resolve a DNS name when a
        previous attempt failed. The default value is 15 minutes.               ResolvePeerBackoffMaxTimes
         This value controls how many times W32time attempts to resolve a DNS name before the discovery process is restarted.
        Each time DNS name resolution fails, the amount of time to wait before the next attempt will be twice the previous
        amount. The default value is seven attempts.               SpecialPollInterval
         This NTP client value, expressed in seconds, controls how often a manually configured time source is polled when the
        time source is configured to use a special polling interval. If the                  SpecialInterval
         flag is enabled on the                  NTPServer
         setting, the client uses the value that is set as the                  SpecialPollInterval
        , instead of a variable interval between                  MinPollInterval
         and                  MaxPollInterval
         values, to determine how frequently to poll the time source.                  SpecialPollInterval
         must be in the range of                  MinPollInterval
        ,                  MaxPollInterval
        , else the nearest value of the range is picked. Default 1024 seconds.               EventLogFlags
         This value is a bitmask that controls events that may be logged to the System log in Event Viewer. Setting this value
        to 0x1 indicates that W32time will create an event whenever a time jump is detected. Setting this value to 0x2 indicates
        that W32time will create an event whenever a time source change is made. Because it is a bitmask value, setting 0x3 the
        addition of 0x1 and 0x2 indicates that both time jumps and time source changes will be logged.

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able

        Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able

    description: |
        This policy setting lets you prevent apps and features from working with files on OneDrive using the Next Generation
        Sync Client.
        The recommended state for this setting is                Enabled
        .
    remediation: |
        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to                    Enabled
        :                 Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\OneDrive\Prevent the usage
        of OneDrive for file storage
         Note:
         This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy template
        SkyDrive.admx/adml
         that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server 2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer). However, we
        strongly recommend you only use the version included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1607 & Server 2016
        Administrative Templates (or newer). Older versions of the templates had conflicting settings in different template
        files for both OneDrive & SkyDrive, until it was cleaned up properly in the above version.                 Note #2:
         In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was named                    Prevent the usage of
        SkyDrive for file storage
        , but it was renamed starting with the Windows 10 RTM (Release 1507) Administrative Templates.                 Impact:
        Users can't access OneDrive from the OneDrive app and file picker. Windows Store apps can't access OneDrive using the
        WinRT
         API. OneDrive doesn't appear in the navigation pane in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the
        cloud. Users can't automatically upload photos and videos from the camera roll folder.                   Note:
         If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users from saving files to
        OneDrive/SkyDrive.                   Note #2:
         If your organization has decided to implement                      OneDrive for Business
         and therefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you also obtain and utilize the
        OneDrive.admx/adml
         template that is bundled with the latest OneDrive client, as noted                      at this link
         (this template is not included with the Windows Administrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in
        particular from that template are worth your consideration:                   Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only
        specific organizations
         - a computer-based setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only                        approved
         tenant IDs.                     Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts
         - a user-based setting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business).

        1.0 will be required to authenticate to the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not supported, the connection fails. Note:
         By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established
        the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the
        Server authentication certificate template
         setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate
        template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a
        valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the server for it to work.
        Note #2:
         Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this
        setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before
        the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP
        host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon
        screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon”

        The Key Management Service KMS is a Microsoft license activation method that entails setting up a local server to store
        the software licenses. The KMS server itself needs to connect to Microsoft to activate the KMS service, but subsequent
        onnetwork clients can activate Microsoft Windows OS and/or their Microsoft Office via the KMS server instead of
        connecting directly to Microsoft. This policy setting lets you optout of sending KMS client activation data to Microsoft

    description: |
        This policy setting ensures that temporary user accounts are automatically removed or disabled after the crisis is
        resolved or within 72 hours of the crisis. Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation
        procedures when there is a need for shortterm accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.
    remediation: |
        Remove any temporary user accounts after a crisis has been resolved or configure the accounts to automatically expire
        within 72 hours.
        Domain accounts can be configured with an account expiration date, under                Account
         properties.             Local accounts can be configured to expire with the following command:
        Open the                  Command Prompt

        Type                  Net user [username] /expires:[mm/dd/yyyy]
         where username is the name of the temporary user account               Impact: If temporary accounts are used, the
        operating system must be configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a DoD-defined time period
        of 72 hours.
