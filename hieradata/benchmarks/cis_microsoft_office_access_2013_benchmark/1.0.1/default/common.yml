        This policy setting controls whether trusted locations on the network can be used. The recommended state for this
        setting is  Disabled .

        Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Access 2013\Application Settings\Security\Trust Center\Trusted
        Locations\Allow Trusted Locations on the network Impact: Disabling this setting will cause disruption for users who add
        network locations to the Trusted Locations list. However, this practice is discouraged (as the Allow Trusted Locations
        on my network (not recommended) check box itself states), so in practice it should be possible to disable this setting
        in most situations without causing significant usability issues for most users.

    description: |
        This policy setting allows administrators to disable all trusted locations in the specified applications. Trusted
        locations specified in the Trust Center are used to define file locations that are assumed to be safe. Content, code,
        and addins are allowed to load from trusted locations with a minimal amount of security, without prompting the users for
        permission. If a dangerous file is opened from a trusted location, it will not be subject to standard security measures
        and could harm users computers or data. The recommended state for this setting is  Enabled .

        that application add-ins are signed by trusted publisher Impact: Enabling this setting could cause disruptions for users
        who rely on add-ins that are not signed by trusted publishers. These users will either have to obtain signed versions of
        such add-ins or stop using them. Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted
        publisher store. Earlier versions of Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the
        certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Office still reads trusted publisher certificate
        information from the Office trusted publisher store, but does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you
        created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Office and you upgrade to the Office release, your trusted
        publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be
        stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store.

        Notification Settings Impact: This configuration causes documents and templates that contain unsigned macros to lose any
        functionality supplied by those macros. To prevent this loss of functionality, users can install the macros in a trusted
        location, unless the Disable all trusted locations setting is configured to Enabled, which will block them from doing
        so. If your organization does not use any officially sanctioned macros, consider choosing No Warnings for all macros but
        disable all macros for even stronger security.

        this requirement themselves in the Add-ins category of the Trust Center for the application. To enforce this
        requirement, you must enable the Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher setting in Group
        Policy, which prevents users from changing the setting themselves.
