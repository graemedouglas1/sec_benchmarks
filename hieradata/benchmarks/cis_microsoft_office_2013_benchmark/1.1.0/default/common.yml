        Safety Feature Impact: When set to Enabled, MIME sniffing will not promote a file of one type to a more dangerous file
        type. If you disable this policy setting, MIME sniffing configures Internet Explorer processes to allow promotion of a
        file from one type to a more dangerous file type. For example, a text file could be promoted to an executable file,
        which is dangerous because any code in the supposed text file would be executed.

        This setting determines whether Microsoft Internet Explorer performs its typical safety checks on Microsoft ActiveXx00AE
        controls when opening URLs that are passed to it by an Office application. By default, Internet Explorer performs
        additional safety checks when ActiveX controls are initialized. Specifically, it prevents the control from being created
        if the kill bit is set in the registry. It also checks the security settings for the zone of the URL in which the
        control is instantiated to determine whether the control can be safely initialized. For the same behavior of the
        selectable applications, such as Excel and Word when they instantiate the use of Internet Explorer, the policy must be

        Download Impact: User initiated downloads can still occur so the majority of legitimate user download interactions
        remain unaffected. Hiding website-initiated prompt messages makes it impossible for a malicious website to initiate a
        download by itself. Such a site can no longer confuse a user into downloading a file that could then open on the user's
        computer to execute an attack. However, some valid websites may initiate file downloads. If this setting is enabled,
        users cannot view download prompts, and remain unaware when a download is available. If such sites reside in an
        organization's intranet, they should display a link to prompt users to initiate valid downloads if the automatic
        download process does not occur. This type of functionality is already in common use on many major internet sites and
        should not confuse users. It is possible that some advanced users may expect their user preferences to control this
        behavior, and for this reason, they may be confused when this preference is overridden by this setting.
