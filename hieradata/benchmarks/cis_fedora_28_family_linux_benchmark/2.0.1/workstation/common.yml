         filesystem type is a compressed readonly Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems. A
        squashfs
         image can be used without having to first decompress the image.
    remediation: |
        Edit or create a file in the                    /etc/modprobe.d/
         directory ending in                    .conf

         module:                 # modprobe -r squashfs
         Impact:
        As Snap packages utilizes                      squashfs
         as a compressed filesystem, disabling                      squashfs
         will cause Snap packages to fail.                   Snap
         application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike
        traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux
        distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's
        end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and
        can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.

         filesystem type is the universal disk format used to implement ISO/IEC 13346 and ECMA167 specifications. This is an
        open vendor filesystem type for data storage on a broad range of media. This filesystem type is necessary to support

    title: '1.1.2.1 | Ensure tmp is a separate partition'
    section: 'Configure /tmp'
    description: |
        The                /tmp
         directory is a worldwritable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications.
    remediation: |
        First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that                    /tmp
         will be mounted at boot time.                 # systemctl unmask tmp.mount

        For specific configuration requirements of the                    /tmp
         mount for your environment, modify                    /etc/fstab
        .
        Example of using                    tmpfs
         with specific mount options:                 tmpfs	/tmp	tmpfs     defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G  0 0
         Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary
        depending on your environment. <device> /tmp    <fstype>    defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec   0 0
         Impact:
        Since the                      /tmp
         directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate
        partition.
        Running out of                      /tmp
         space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where
        /tmp
         is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only
        creates a single                      /
         partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                      /tmp
         (as with                      tmpfs
        ) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.
        Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for                      /tmp
         from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than
        tmpfs
         which is RAM-based.                   /tmp
         utilizing                      tmpfs
         can be resized using the                      size={size}
         parameter in the relevant entry in                      /etc/fstab
        .

        Internet Protocol Version 6 IPv6 is the most recent version of Internet Protocol IP. Its designed to supply IP
        addressing and additional security to support the predicted growth of connected devices.
    remediation: |
        If
         IPv6 is to be disabled, use                  one
         of the two following methods to disable IPv6 on the system:
        To disable IPv6 through the GRUB2 config, run the following command to add                  ipv6.disable=1
         to the                  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
         parameters:               grubby --update-kernel ALL --args 'ipv6.disable=1'
         OR
         To disable IPv6 through sysctl settings, set the following parameters in                  /etc/sysctl.conf
         or a                  /etc/sysctl.d/*
         file:               Example:
        # printf "
        net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
        net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
        " >> /etc/sysctl.d/60-disable_ipv6.conf
                       Run the following command to set the active kernel parameters:
        # {
           sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
           sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
           sysctl -w net.ipv6.route.flush=1
        }
                       Impact: IETF RFC 4038 recommends that applications are built with an assumption of dual stack.
        If IPv6 is disabled through sysctl config,                    SSH X11forwarding
         may no longer function as expected. We recommend that SSH X11fowarding be disabled, but if required, the following will
        allow for                    SSH X11forwarding
         with IPv6 disabled through sysctl config:
        Add the following line the                    /etc/ssh/sshd_config

        replies to the SYN with a SYNACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and
        destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK
        packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it
        has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the

        relation, which means that a connection, interface or source can only be part of one zone, but a zone can be used for
        many network connections, interfaces and sources. The default zone is the zone that is used for everything that is not
        explicitly bound/assigned to another zone. If no zone assigned to a connection, interface or source, only the default
        zone is used. The default zone is not always listed as being used for an interface or source as it will be used for it
        either way. This depends on the manager of the interfaces. Connections handled by NetworkManager are listed as
        NetworkManager requests to add the zone binding for the interface used by the connection. Also interfaces under control
        of the network service are listed also because the service requests it. Note A firewalld zone configuration file
        contains the information for a zone. These are the zone description, services, ports, protocols, icmpblocks, masquerade,
        forwardports and rich language rules in an XML file format.

         Special mount points
        If there are any special mount points that are not visible by default from just scanning                    /
        , change the                    PARTITION
         variable to the appropriate partition and re-run the remediation.                 Impact:
        Both the audit and remediation section of this recommendation will traverse all mounted file systems that is not mounted
        with either                      noexec
         or                      nosuid
         mount options. If there are large file systems without these mount options,                      such traversal will be
        significantly detrimental to the performance of the system.
                           Before running either the audit or remediation section, inspect the output of the following command
        to determine exactly which file systems will be traversed: # findmnt -n -l -k -it $(awk '/nodev/ { print $2 }'
        /proc/filesystems | paste -sd,) | grep -Pv "noexec|nosuid"

        To exclude a particular file system due to adverse performance impacts, update the audit and remediation sections by
        adding a sufficiently unique string to the                      grep
         statement. The above command can be used to test the modified exclusions.

    section: 'Configure rsyslog'
    description: |
        RSyslog will create logfiles that do not already exist on the system. This setting controls what permissions will be
        applied to these newly created files.
    remediation: |
        Edit either                    /etc/rsyslog.conf
         or a dedicated                    .conf
         file in                    /etc/rsyslog.d/
         and set                    $FileCreateMode
         to                    0640
         or more restrictive:                 $FileCreateMode 0640
         Restart the service: # systemctl restart rsyslog
         Impact:
        The systems global                      umask
         could override, but only making the file permissions stricter, what is configured in RSyslog with the
        FileCreateMode
         directive. RSyslog  also has it's own                      $umask
         directive that can alter the intended file creation mode. In addition, consideration should be given to how
        FileCreateMode
         is used.
        Thus it is critical to ensure that the intended file creation mode is not overridden with less restrictive settings in
        /etc/rsyslog.conf
        ,                      /etc/rsyslog.d/*conf
         files and that                      FileCreateMode
         is set before any file is created.

        SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to
        clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system
        administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines

        backends. In those environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By
        utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify
        the applications.

         and              ClientAliveCountMax
         control the timeout of ssh sessions.           ClientAliveInterval
         sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message
        through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages
        will not be sent to the client.             ClientAliveCountMax
         sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If
        this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the
        session. The default value is                3
        .
                       The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel

        Example The default value is 3.  If                ClientAliveInterval
         is set to 15, and                ClientAliveCountMax
         is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds

    description: |
        The user filecreation mode mask              umask
         is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for
        any newly created directory is 0777              rwxrwxrwx
        , and for any newly created file it is 0666              rwrwrw
        . The              umask
         modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting masking these permissions. The              umask
         is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the              umask
         are cleared in the resulting file mode.           umask
         can be set with either              octal
         or              Symbolic
         values           Octal
         Numeric Value  Represented by either three or four digits. ie                umask 0027
         or                umask 027
        .  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting
        permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.             Symbolic
         Value  Represented by a comma separated list for User                u
        , group                g
        , and world/other                o
        .  The permissions listed are not masked by                umask
        . ie a                umask
         set by                umask urwx,grx,o
         is the                Symbolic
         equivalent of the                Octal
                       umask 027
        .  This                umask
         would set a newly created directory with file mode                drwxrx
         and a newly created file with file mode                rwr
        .
        The default              umask
         can be set to use the              pamumask
         module or in a              System Wide Shell Configuration File
        .  The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or
        choosing a different default              umask
         by adding the              umask
         command into a              User Shell Configuration File

        , in their home directory.           Setting the default umask
