    description: |
        The                squashfs
         filesystem type is a compressed readonly Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems similar to
        cramfs
         . A                squashfs
         image can be used without having to first decompress the image.
    remediation: |
        Edit or create a file in the                    /etc/modprobe.d/
         directory ending in .conf
        Example:                    vi /etc/modprobe.d/squashfs.conf
                         and add the following line: install squashfs /bin/true

         module:                 # rmmod squashfs
         Impact: Disabling squashfs will prevent the use of snap.  Snap is a package manager for Linux for installing Snap
        packages. "Snap" application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions.
        This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted
        packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to
        their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from
        any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment. When snaps are deployed on versions of Linux, the
        Ubuntu app store is used as default back-end, but other stores can be enabled as well.

        Create or update an entry for                  /tmp
         in either                  /etc/fstab
                         OR
         in a systemd                  tmp.mount
         file:               If /etc/fstab
         is used: configure                  /etc/fstab
          as appropriate.               _ Example:_ tmpfs	/tmp	tmpfs     defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime  0 0

        Run the following command to remount                  /tmp

         file is used: run the following command to create the file                  /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount
         if it doesn't exist:               # [ ! -f /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount ] && cp -v /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount
        /etc/systemd/system/

        Edit the file                  /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount
        :
        [Mount]
        What=tmpfs
        Where=/tmp
        Type=tmpfs
        Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid
                       Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon: # systemctl daemon-reload

        Run the following command to unmask and start                  tmp.mount
        :               # systemctl --now unmask tmp.mount
         Impact:
        Since the                    /tmp
         directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate
        partition.
        Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default
        installation a disk-based                    /tmp
         will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single                    /
         partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based                    /tmp
         as with                    tmpfs
         will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.

        Disable XD. This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated
        whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32bit x86

        The Network Information Service NIS, formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a clientserver directory service protocol used
        to distribute system configuration files. The NIS client               ypbind
          was used to bind a machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed configuration files.

        Use                  one
         of the two following methods to disable IPv6 on the system:               To disable IPv6 through the GRUB2 config:
        Edit                  /etc/default/grub
         and add                  ipv6.disable=1

         configuration:               # grub2-mkconfig –o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

        many network connections, interfaces and sources. The default zone is the zone that is used for everything that is not
        explicitly bound/assigned to another zone. If no zone assigned to a connection, interface or source, only the default
        zone is used. The default zone is not always listed as being used for an interface or source as it will be used for it
        either way. This depends on the manager of the interfaces. Connections handled by NetworkManager are listed as
        NetworkManager requests to add the zone binding for the interface used by the connection. Also interfaces under control
        of the network service are listed also because the service requests it. Note A firewalld zone configuration file

    title: '4.1.3.12 | Ensure discretionary access control permission modification events are collected - manual'
    section: 'Configure auditd rules'
    description: |
        Monitor changes to file permissions, attributes, ownership and group. The parameters in this section track changes for
        system calls that affect file permissions and attributes. The                chmod
         ,                fchmod
         and                fchmodat
          system calls affect the permissions associated with a file. The                chown
         ,                fchown
         ,                fchownat
         and                lchown
          system calls affect owner and group attributes on a file. The                setxattr
         ,                lsetxattr
         ,                fsetxattr
         set extended file attributes and                removexattr
         ,                lremovexattr
         ,                fremovexattr
         remove extended file attributes control extended file attributes. In all cases, an audit record will only be written
        for nonsystem user ids auid 1000 and will ignore Daemon events auid  4294967295. All audit records will be tagged with
        the identifier permmod.             Note
         Systems may have been customized to change the default UIDMIN.  To confirm the UIDMIN for your system, run the
        following command              awk /\sUIDMIN/print 2 /etc/login.defs

        If your systems UIDMIN is not                1000
        , replace                audit1000
         with                auditUIDMIN for your system
         in the Audit and Remediation procedures.             Reloading the auditd config to set active settings may require a
        system reboot.

    section: 'Configure journald'
    description: |
        Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server.  Utilities exist to accept
        remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service provides a consistent means of log collection and
        export. Notes This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a
        remote log host has been implemented.
        The main configuration file                    /etc/systemd/journald.conf
         is read before any of the custom .conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration
        parameters
        As noted in the journald man pages journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here,
        or through a facility like                    systemdjournald.service
        .  There are tradeoffs involved in each implementation, where                    ForwardToSyslog
         will immediately capture all events and forward to an external log server, if properly configured, but may not capture
        all bootup activities.  Mechanisms such as                    systemdjournald.service

        will not be sent to the client.             ClientAliveCountMax
         sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If
        this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the
        session. The default value is                3

        SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to
        clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system

    section: 'Configure PAM'
    description: |
        Lock out users after              n
         unsuccessful consecutive login attempts.
        These settings are commonly configured with the              pamfaillock.so
         module.  Some environments may continue using the              pamtally2.so
         module, where this older method may simplify automation in mixed environments.
        Set the lockout number in              deny
         to the policy in effect at your site.           unlocktimen
         is the number of seconds the account remains locked after the number of attempts configured in              denyn
         has been met.           Notes Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here. When
        modifying authentication configuration using the authconfig utility, the systemauth and passwordauth files are
        overwritten with the settings from the authconfig utility. This can be avoided by creating symbolic links in place of
        the configuration files, which authconfig recognizes and does not overwrite.  These symbolic links are the default for
        Fedora 19 derived distributions. Use of the audit keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during
        authentication.  This risk should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your organization.
        If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive failure count defined by
        deny
         in the                  pamfaillock.so
         or the                  pamtally2.so
         module, the user can be unlocked by issuing following commands. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively
        unlocking the user.
        If                      pamfaillock.so
         is used                    faillock user username reset

        If                      pamtally2.so

        The                    auth
         sections should look similar to the following example:
        Note: The ordering on the lines in the auth section is important. The                    preauth
         line needs to below the line                    auth        required      pam_env.so

    section: 'User Accounts and Environment'
    description: |
        The user filecreation mode mask              umask
         is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for
        any newly created directory is 0777 rwxrwxrwx, and for any newly created file it is 0666 rwrwrw. The              umask
         modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting masking these permissions. The              umask
         is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the              umask
         are cleared in the resulting file mode.           umask
         can be set with either              octal
         or              Symbolic
         values           Octal
         Numeric Value  Represented by either three or four digits. ie                umask 0027
         or                umask 027
        .  If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting
        permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.             Symbolic
         Value  Represented by a comma separated list for User                u
        , group                g
        , and world/other                o
        .  The permissions listed are not masked by                umask
        . ie a                umask
         set by                umask urwx,grx,o
         is the                Symbolic
         equivalent of the                Octal
                       umask 027
        .  This                umask
         would set a newly created directory with file mode                drwxrx
         and a newly created file with file mode                rwr
        .
        The default              umask
         can be set to use the              pamumask
         module or in a              System Wide Shell Configuration File
        .  The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or
        choosing a different default              umask
         by adding the              umask
         command into a              User Shell Configuration File
        ,               .bashprofile
         or              .bashrc
        , in their home directory.           Setting the default umask
        pamumask module

        will set the umask according to the system default in                    /etc/login.defs

        The RPM package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the               V
         option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The              V
          option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the
        package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option
        Code   Meaning
        S      File size differs.
        M      File mode differs includes permissions and file type.
        5      The MD5 checksum differs.
        D      The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.
        L      A mismatch occurs in a link.
        U      The file ownership differs.
        G      The file group owner differs.
        T      The file time mtime differs.

        The              rpm qf
         command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following commands
        determines which package the              /etc/ssh/sshdconfig
         file belongs to
         rpm qf /etc/ssh/sshdconfig

        opensshserver7.4p121.el7.x8664

        To verify the settings for the package that controls the              /bin/bash
         file, run the following
         rpm V opensshserver7.4p121.el7.x8664

        S.5....T.  c /etc/ssh/sshdconfig

        Note You can feed the output of the                rpm qf
          command to the                rpm V
          command
          rpm V rpm qf /etc/ssh/sshdconfig

        S.5....T.  c /etc/ssh/sshdconfig
                   Notes Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is recommended to
        verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time consuming task and results may depend on site
        policy therefore it is not a scorable benchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security
        measures. Some of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by this recommendation. The
        audit command will alert for all changes to a file permissions even if the new state is more secure than the default.
