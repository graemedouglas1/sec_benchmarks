        View\Turn off Protected View for attachments opened from Outlook Impact: Opening Office files, such as the Office

        opening and viewing files in Protected View. Users who want to modify these kinds of files must save them to a safe
        location and then open them. When Office application files open in Protected View, some functionality is unavailable.
        The process of dragging the file to a new location and then opening it takes more time than simply double-clicking the
        file to open it, modifying it, and then saving it to the same location. For these reasons, administrators may receive
        some complaints from users potentially confused about how to modify files originally only available to them in Protected
        View.

        certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Office still reads trusted publisher certificate
        information from the Office trusted publisher store, but does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you
        created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Office and you upgrade to the Office release, your trusted
        publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be
        stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store.

        This policy setting controls whether hidden markup is visible when users open PowerPoint files in standard or HTML
        format. The recommended state for this setting is  Enabled .
    remediation: |
        To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting to  Enabled . User
        Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft PowerPoint 2013\PowerPoint Options\Security\Make Hidden Markup Visible
        Impact: If this setting is Enabled, hidden markup will be visible when the file is opened, and if users intend it to be
        hidden they will need to hide it again. (Users can permanently locate and remove undesired markup from files by using
        the Document Inspector feature in PowerPoint.) Enabling this setting enforces the default configuration in PowerPoint.
        In most cases, markup is intended to be visible to users. Markup does not display in presentation mode in PowerPoint,
        even if it is visible in design mode, so it is likely that this setting will have a minimal impact on usability.
