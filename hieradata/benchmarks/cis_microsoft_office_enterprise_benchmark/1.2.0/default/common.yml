        important user functionality.

    section: 'IE Security'
    description: |
        This setting determines whether Microsoft Internet Explorer performs its typical safety checks on Microsoft ActiveX
        controls when opening URLs that are passed to it by an Office application. By default, Internet Explorer performs
        additional safety checks when ActiveX controls are initialized. Specifically, it prevents the control from being created
        if the kill bit is set in the registry. It also checks the security settings for the zone of the URL in which the
        control is instantiated to determine whether the control can be safely initialized. For the same behavior of the
        selectable applications, such as Excel and Word when they instantiate the use of Internet Explorer, the policy must be
        Enabled
         and the applications selected.

         Impact: Enabling this setting can cause some disruptions for users who open Web pages that contain potentially
        dangerous ActiveX controls from Office applications. However, because any affected controls are usually blocked by
        default when Internet Explorer opens Web pages, most users should not experience significant usability issues.

    section: 'IE Security'
    description: |
        Internet Explorer uses Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions MIME data to determine file handling procedures for files
        received through a Web server. This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer requires that all filetype
        information provided by Web servers be consistent. For example, if the MIME type of a file is text/plain but the MIME
        data indicates that the file is really an executable file, Internet Explorer changes its extension to reflect this
        executable status. This capability helps ensure that executable code cannot masquerade as other types of trustable data.
        The recommended state for this setting is                  Enabled groove.exe, excel.exe, mspub.exe, powerpnt.exe,

         Impact: Internet Explorer uses both the extension of the filename and the MIME information to decide how to handle a
        file. Enabling this setting requires that information in the MIME header matches the file extension provided. Since
        mismatched files will be blocked by enabling this setting, ensure that any web server under organizational control is
        set up correctly.

        This setting allows for configuration of policy settings in the zone consistent with a selected security level, for
        example, Low, Medium Low, Medium, or High. When Internet Explorer opens a Web page, it places restrictions on what the
        page can do, based on the pages Internet Explorer security zone. There are several possible security zones, each with
        different sets of restrictions. The security zone for a page is determined by its location. For example, pages that are
        located on the Internet will normally be in the more restrictive Internet security zone. They might not be allowed to
        perform some operations, such as accessing the local hard drive. Pages that are located on your corporate network would
        normally be in the Intranet security zone, and therefore have fewer restrictions.

        This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer MIME sniffing prevents promotion of a file of one type to a
        more dangerous file type. For example, it does not allow script to run from a file marked as text. For Office, this
        setting affects any webbased content that is accessed within Office.

         Impact: When set to Enabled, MIME sniffing will not promote a file of one type to a more dangerous file type. If you

        type to a more dangerous file type. For example, a text file could be promoted to an executable file, which is dangerous
        because any code in the supposed text file would be executed.

        This policy setting controls whether Office applications load any custom user interface UI code included with a document
        or template. Office allows developers to extend the UI with customization code that is included in a document or

        to enable this setting. Sometimes only specific teams in an organization require a modified UI, and this setting could
        be enabled for the rest of the organization.

         In previous versions of Outlook, when security settings were published in a form in Exchange Server public folders,

    description: |
        This policy setting controls whether hyperlinks in suspected phishing email messages in Outlook are allowed. By default,
        Outlook handles suspicious messages in two ways If the Junk Email Filter does not consider a message to be spam but does
        consider it to be phishing, the message    is left in the Inbox but any links in the message are disabled and users
        cannot use the Reply and Reply All   functionality. In addition, any attachments in the suspicious message are blocked.
        If the Junk Email Filter considers the message to be both spam and phishing, the message is automatically sent to    the
        Junk Email folder. Any message sent to the Junk Email folder is converted to plain text format and all links    are
        disabled. In addition, the Reply and Reply All functionality is disabled and any attachments in the message are
        blocked. The InfoBar alerts users to this change in functionality. If users are certain that a message is legitimate,
        they can click the InfoBar and enable the links in the message. Users can change the way Outlook handles phishing
        messages in the Junk Email Options dialog box by clearing the Disable links and other functionality in phishing messages
        Recommended check box. If this check box is cleared, Outlook will not disable links in suspected phishing messages
        unless they are classified as junk email, which could allow users to disclose confidential information to malicious Web
        sites.

        This policy setting controls the security level for macros in Outlook. Macros are a single instruction that expands
        automatically into a set of instructions to perform a particular task. Available Policy Options Always warn
          This option corresponds to the Warnings for all macros option in the Macro Security section of    the Outlook Trust
        Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the    macros are signed by a
        trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog box    with information about the
        macro and its digital signature if present, and allows users to enable the macro or    leave it disabled.
        Never warn, disable all
          This option corresponds to the No warnings and disable all macros option in the Trust    Center. Outlook disables all
        macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does not notify users.               Warning for signed, disable
        unsigned
          This option corresponds to the Warnings for signed macros all unsigned    macros are disabled option in the Trust
        Center. Outlook handles macros as follows               If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro
        can run if the user has already trusted the
        publisher. If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog
        box
        for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for
        the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without
        prompting the user in the future. If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the
        user, unless it is
        opened from a trusted location. No security check
          This option corresponds to the No security check for macros Not recommended option in the    Trust Center. Outlook
        runs all macros without prompting users. This configuration makes users computers    vulnerable to potentially malicious
        code and is not recommended.
