         Applies UAC tokenfiltering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in powerful group such as Administrators is
        disabled and powerful privileges are removed from the resulting access token. This configures the
        LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy
         registry value to              0
        . This is the default behavior for Windows.           Disabled

        does not correctly import connected interface subnet routes. Instead, this router injects host routes into the OSPF
        routes. However, the OSPF router cannot be used as an ASBR router, and when connected interface subnet routes are
        imported into OSPF the result is confusing routing tables with strange routing paths.

        This policy setting allows you to control how BitLockerprotected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of
        the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. The Allow
        certificatebased data recovery agent check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with
        BitLockerprotected operating system drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public
        Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker
        Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents. In
        Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to
        generate a 48digit recovery password or a 256bit recovery key. Select Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup
        wizard to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will
        not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for
        the drive are determined by the policy setting. In Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain
        Services, choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives. If you select
        Backup recovery password and key package, both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS.
        Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select Backup
        recovery password only, only the recovery password is stored in AD DS. Select the Do not enable BitLocker until recovery
        information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives check box if you want to prevent users from enabling
        BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS

        If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM check box.
        In this mode a USB drive is required for startup and the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB
        drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is
        accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access
        the drive. On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide
        added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can
        also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4digit to 20digit personal
        identification number PIN, or both. Users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard. Note 2

         Impact: When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is
        set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of
        recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of
        this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a
        configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack.
        These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
        monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other
        automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
        compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able
        to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

         By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established
        the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the
        Server authentication certificate template
         setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate
        template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a
        valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the workstation for it to work.
        Note #2:
         Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this
        setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before

        host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon
        screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon”

        security audit event is generated only for all objects for all types of access requested. If you configure this policy
        setting, an audit event is generated each time an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage. Success
        audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts. If you do not configure this policy
        setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage.
        The recommended state for this setting is            Success and Failure
        .         Note
         A Windows 8.0, Server 2012 nonR2 or newer OS is required to access and set this value in Group Policy.

        include 4960 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate
        a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the
        remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability
        problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this
        problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962 IPsec dropped an inbound packet that
        failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963 IPsec
        dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing
        its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. 4965 IPsec received a
        packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index SPI. This is usually caused by malfunctioning
        hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are
        the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec
        implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. 5478 IPsec Services has
        started successfully. 5479 IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the
        computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5480 IPsec Services
        failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some
        of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor

        started. 5484 IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services
        can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. 5485 IPsec
        Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plugandplay event for network interfaces. This poses a potential

    section: 'Device Lock'
    description: |
        This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting
        range from 0 to 730 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack
        passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password.
        However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to
        users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.
        The recommended state for this setting is            365 or fewer days, but not 0
        .
    remediation: |
        To establish the recommended configuration via configuration profiles, set the following Settings Catalog path to

        :             Device Lock\Device Password Enabled: Device Password Expiration
         Impact: If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a
        configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location
        or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced
        because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

    description: |
        This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account
        before you can reuse an old password. In an Intune managed environment this setting applies to local user accounts and
        not Entra ID accounts. The value includes the users current password. This value denotes that with a setting of 1, the
        user cant reuse their current password when choosing a new password, while a setting of 5 means that a user cant set
        their new password to their current password or any of their previous four passwords.
        The recommended state for this setting is            24 or more passwords
        .

        :             Device Lock\Device Password Enabled: Device Password History
         Impact: The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to
        change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk
        of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create
        passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make
        them easier to guess. Warning:

    section: 'Device Lock'
    description: |
        This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a local user account. There
        are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps passphrase
        is a better term than password. In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include
        spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as I want to drink a 5 milkshake is a valid passphrase it is a considerably stronger
        password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be
        educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise
        environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this
        value to meet your organizations business requirements.
        The recommended state for this setting is            14 or more characters
        .
    remediation: |

        14 or more character(s)
        :             Device Lock\Device Password Enabled: Min Device Password Length
         Impact: Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users
        might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords
        could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten
        passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to
        remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Warning:

        If you select                  Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session

        This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer. The Public Key Cryptography
        Based UsertoUser PKU2U protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support
        provider SSP. The SSP enables peertopeer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing
        feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.
        With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,            Spnego.dll
        . In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension
        SSP for Negotiate,            Negoexts.dll
        , which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.
        When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,            Negoexts.dll
         calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the
        policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to
        the logon peer for validation and associates the users certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

        LAN Manager LM was a family of early Microsoft client/server software predating Windows NT that allowed users to link
        personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing,
        user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the
        default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory
        will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 NTLMv2 variants, and
        is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations Join a
        domain Authenticate between Active Directory forests Authenticate to downlevel domains Authenticate to computers that do
        not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The
        Network security LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is

        are more likely if the device reboots after policies are applied. To work around this issue, the policies can be
        targeted to users instead of devices so that they apply later in the process. An exception to this recommendation may be
        needed if Windows AutoPilot is used.

                           Local Policies Security Options\User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard

         Impact: When an operation requires elevation of privilege, a configurable access denied error message is displayed. An
        enterprise that is running desktops as standard user may choose this setting to reduce help desk calls. Note:
         With this setting configured as recommended, the default error message displayed when a user attempts to perform an
        operation or run a program requiring privilege elevation (without Administrator rights) is "                 This
        program will not run. This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.
        " Some users who are not used to seeing this message may believe that the operation or program they attempted to run is
        specifically blocked by group policy, as that is what the message seems to imply. This message may therefore result in
        user questions as to why that specific operation/program is blocked, when in fact, the problem is that they need to
        perform the operation or run the program with an Administrative account (or "Run as Administrator" if it
        is
         already an Administrator account), and they are not doing that.               Note #2:
         When using third-party remote support tools, this recommendation could prevent Administrators from entering their
        administrative credentials. In this case, an exception to this recommendation will be needed.

        If you remove this user right on Member Servers, users will not be able to connect to those servers through the network.
        Successful negotiation of IPsec connections requires that the initiating machine has this right, therefore if using
        IPsec, it is recommended that it be assigned to the                  Authenticated Users
         group. If you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET or Internet Information Services (IIS), you may need
        to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. It is important to verify that
        authorized users are assigned this user right for the computers they need to access the network.

        This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system
        objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic
        link. A symbolic link is a pointer much like a shortcut or .lnk file to another file system object, which can be a file,
        folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only
        works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with
        symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
        Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For
        this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only

        not available when using Azure AD for backup. These were excluded from the Intune benchmark as they cannot be selected
        unless Active Directory is selected as the backup location.

    description: |
        This policy settings configures postauthentication actions which will be executed after detecting an authentication by
        the LAPS managed account. The            Action
         refers to actions to take upon expiry of the grace period before executing the specified postauthentication actions.
        Postauthentication actions Reset password
         upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset.           Reset the password and logoff
        the managed account
         upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset and any interactive logon sessions using
        the managed account will terminated.           Reset the password and reboot the device
         upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset and the managed device will be immediately
        rebooted.           Warning
         After an interactive logon session is terminated, other authenticated sessions using the Windows LAPS managed account
        may still be active. The only way to ensure that the previous password is no longer in use is to reboot the OS.
        The recommended state for this setting is            Reset the password and logoff the managed account
         or higher.         Note
         Organizations that utilize thirdparty commercial software to manage unique  complex local Administrator passwords on
        domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.         Note 2
         Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers  they must be joined to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID
        formerly Azure Active Directory.
