    title: '1.1.2.3 | L1 Ensure Authentication with Exchange server.  is set to  EnabledKerberosNTLM Password Authentication'
    section: 'Exchange'
    description: |
        This policy setting controls which authentication method Outlook uses to authenticate with Microsoft Exchange Server.
        Note  Exchange Server supports the Kerberos authentication protocol and NTLM for authentication. The Kerberos protocol
        is the more secure authentication method and is supported on Windows 2000 Server and later versions. NTLM authentication
        is supported in preWindows 2000 environments.
                              If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three different options for controlling how
        Outlook authenticates with Microsoft Exchange Server  Kerberos/NTLM password authentication. Outlook attempts to
        authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol. If this attempt fails, Outlook attempts to authenticate using
        NTLM. This option is the default configuration.  Kerberos password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate
        using the Kerberos protocol only.  NTLM password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using NTLM only. If
        you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will attempt to authenticate using the Kerberos
        authentication protocol. If it cannot because no Windows 2000 or later domain controllers are available, it will
        authenticate using NTLM. The recommended state for this setting is  EnabledKerberos/NTLM Password Authentication .
        NOTE  When connecting to Office 365, this setting must be set to  Disabled .
    remediation: |
        To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting to  Enabled . User

        Impact: The recommended value for this setting in the Microsoft baselines enforces the default configuration, and is
        therefore unlikely to cause significant usability issues for most users.

        not configure this policy setting, Outlook does not run scripts in forms in which the script and the layout are

        therefore unlikely to cause significant usability issues for most users.  Allowing scripts to run in one-off Outlook
        forms can pose a significant risk. Unless your users have a legitimate business need for such functionality, this
        setting should be disabled. If your organization uses forms with scripts, consider redesigning these forms.

        This policy setting controls whether Outlook prompts users before executing a custom action. Custom actions add
        functionality to Outlook that can be triggered as part of a rule. Among other possible features, custom actions can be
        created that reply to messages in ways that circumvent the Outlook models programmatic send protections.  If you enable
        this policy setting, you can choose from four options to control how Outlook functions when a custom action is executed

        security. This option enforces the default configuration in Outlook. If you disable or do not configure this policy
        setting, when Outlook or another program initiates a custom action using the Outlook object model, users are prompted to
        allow or reject the action. If this configuration is changed, malicious code can use the Outlook object model to

        This policy setting controls which set of security settings are enforced in Outlook.  If you enable this policy setting,
        you can choose from four options for enforcing Outlook security settings   Outlook Default Security  This option is the
        default configuration in Outlook. Users can configure security themselves, and Outlook ignores any securityrelated
        settings configured in Group Policy.   Use Security Form from Outlook Security Settings Public Folder  Outlook uses the
        settings from the security form published in the designated public folder.   Use Security Form from Outlook 10 Security
        Settings Public Folder  Outlook uses the settings from the security form published in the designated public folder.
        Use Outlook Security Group Policy  Outlook uses security settings from Group Policy.  Important  You must enable this
        policy setting if you want to apply the other Outlook security policy settings mentioned in this guide.  If you disable
        or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook users can configure security for themselves, and Outlook ignores any
        securityrelated settings that are configured in Group Policy.  Note  In previous versions of Outlook, when security
        settings were published in a form in Exchange Server public folders, users who needed these settings required the
        HKEYCURRENTUSER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Security\CheckAdminSettings registry key to be set on their computers for
        the settings to apply. In Outlook, the CheckAdminSettings registry key is no longer used to determine users security
        settings. Instead, the Outlook Security Mode setting can be used to determine whether Outlook security should be
        controlled directly by Group Policy, by the security form from the Outlook Security Settings Public Folder, or by the
        settings on users own computers The recommended state for this setting is  EnabledUse Outlook Security Group Policy .

        This policy setting controls the security level for macros in Outlook.  If you enable this policy setting, you can
        choose from four options for handling macros in Outlook Always warn. This option corresponds to the Warnings for all
        macros option in the Macro Security section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened
        from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays
        a security alert dialog box with information about the macro and its digital signature if present, and allows users to
        enable the macro or leave it disabled. Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the No warnings and disable
        all macros option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does
        not notify users.  Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the Warnings for signed macros all
        unsigned macros are disabled option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows  If a macro is digitally
        signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher.  If a macro has a valid
        signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user
        choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the
        publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future.  If a macro does
        not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location.
                              This option is the default configuration in Outlook. No security check. This option corresponds to
        the No security check for macros Not recommended option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without prompting
        users. This configuration makes users computers vulnerable to potentially malicious code and is not recommended. If you
        disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of Enabled  Warning for signed, disable
        unsigned. The recommended state for this setting is  EnabledNever warn, disable all .

        will cause Outlook users to lose the benefits of any functionality provided by macros. Users who wish to benefit from
        macros can install the macros in a trusted location, unless Disable all trusted locations is set to Enabled.
